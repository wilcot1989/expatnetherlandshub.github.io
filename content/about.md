## Hi, I'm Sarah

I'm Sarah van den Berg — half Dutch, half British, and fully committed to making expat life in the Netherlands a little less confusing.

I moved to the Netherlands over 10 years ago. Even with my Dutch roots, navigating the bureaucracy, tax system, and housing market was overwhelming. I can only imagine what it's like when you're starting completely from scratch.

That experience is why I started Expat Netherlands Hub. I've helped dozens of expats settle in — from sorting out their BSN and health insurance to finding an apartment and understanding the 30% ruling.

## What You'll Find Here

Every guide on this site comes from real experience. When I write about the Dutch tax system, it's because I've filed my own returns and helped others do the same. When I recommend a bank account, it's because I've actually used it.

I focus on practical, actionable advice. No vague overviews — just clear steps you can follow today.

## My Background

- Born in the UK to a Dutch mother and British father
- Moved to the Netherlands in 2016
- Certified relocation consultant
- Fluent in English and Dutch
- Based in Utrecht

## How This Site Makes Money

Full transparency: some links on this site are affiliate links. If you sign up for a service through my link (like Wise or a health insurance provider), I earn a small commission. You pay the same price — sometimes even less with exclusive deals.

This is how I keep the site running and the guides free. My recommendations are always based on what I'd genuinely suggest to a friend.
