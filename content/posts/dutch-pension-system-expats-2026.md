faq:
  - q: "How does the Dutch pension system work?"
    a: "The Dutch pension system has three pillars: (1) AOW — state pension for everyone who lived/worked in the Netherlands, currently about €1,330/month for singles. (2) Employer pension — occupational pension through your employer's pension fund, typically 60-70% of your salary after 40 years. (3) Private pension — individual savings and investments with tax advantages."
  - q: "Am I entitled to AOW as an expat?"
    a: "You build up 2% AOW for each year you live or work in the Netherlands between age 15 and retirement age (67). If you lived in the Netherlands for 10 years, you receive 20% of the full AOW (about €266/month). You can voluntarily continue building AOW if you leave the Netherlands, but you must apply within 10 years of departure."
  - q: "What happens to my Dutch pension if I leave the Netherlands?"
    a: "Your AOW right is preserved — you receive 2% per year lived in NL, payable worldwide. Your employer pension stays with the pension fund and will be paid out at retirement age, also worldwide. You can sometimes transfer your employer pension to a pension fund in your new country (EU value transfer regulation)."
  - q: "How much pension do I build up through my employer?"
    a: "Most employer pension schemes build up 1.5-1.875% of your pensionable salary per year. After 40 years, that's 60-75% of your average salary. With the new Dutch pension system (WTP, effective 2027), employers contribute a fixed percentage (typically 20-30% of salary) to an individual pension account."
  - q: "Does the 30% ruling affect my pension?"
    a: "Indirectly yes. The 30% ruling reduces your taxable salary, which means your pensionable salary is also lower (unless your employer uses your full salary as the pension base). This results in lower pension accrual. Check with your employer whether your pension is calculated on your full or reduced salary."
  - q: "Should I save for retirement privately as an expat?"
    a: "Yes, especially if you haven't lived in the Netherlands long enough for a full AOW, or if you plan to retire in a country with a higher cost of living. Consider tax-advantaged options: jaarruimte (annual contribution space), lijfrente (annuity), and investing via a low-cost broker. A financial advisor specialized in expats can help optimize your strategy."

I did not think about my Dutch pension for the first five years I lived here. Big mistake. When I finally looked into it, I realised I had been building up AOW rights without knowing it, my employer had been contributing to a pension fund I had never checked, and I had no idea what any of it meant. If you are an expat wondering whether any of this matters to you -- it does, even if you are not planning to retire here. Let me break it down.

## The Three Pillars

| Pillar | What | Who Pays | How Much |
|--------|------|---------|----------|
| **1. AOW** | State pension | Government (via taxes) | ~€1,330/month (single, full) |
| **2. Employer Pension** | Occupational pension | Employer + employee | 60-75% of salary (after 40 years) |
| **3. Private** | Individual savings | You | Tax-advantaged contributions |

## Pillar 1: AOW (State Pension)

### How It Works
AOW (Algemene Ouderdomswet) is the Dutch state pension. You build up 2% for each year you live or work in the Netherlands between age 15 and retirement age.

| Key Facts | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Retirement age** | 67 (2026), linked to life expectancy |
| **Full AOW (single)** | ~€1,330/month gross |
| **Full AOW (couple)** | ~€915/person/month gross |
| **Build-up** | 2% per year (50 years = 100%) |
| **Payable worldwide** | Yes, regardless of where you live |

### AOW for Expats — Calculation

| Years in NL | AOW % | Monthly Amount (single) |
|-------------|-------|----------------------|
| 5 years | 10% | ~€133 |
| 10 years | 20% | ~€266 |
| 15 years | 30% | ~€399 |
| 20 years | 40% | ~€532 |
| 30 years | 60% | ~€798 |
| 50 years | 100% | ~€1,330 |

### What Happens When You Leave
- Your built-up AOW right is preserved
- You can voluntarily continue building AOW for up to 10 years after departure
- Cost: approximately €500-€5,000/year depending on income
- Apply through the SVB (Sociale Verzekeringsbank) within 1 year of leaving

**Important:** If you don't apply for voluntary AOW continuation, you permanently lose those years of accrual.

## Pillar 2: Employer Pension

### How It Works
Most Dutch employers offer a pension scheme through a pension fund or insurance company. It's often mandatory — you're automatically enrolled.

### Key Concepts

| Term | What It Means |
|------|-------------|
| **Pensioengrondslag** | Pensionable salary (salary minus AOW offset) |
| **Franchise** | AOW offset (~€17,500 in 2026) — the part already covered by AOW |
| **Opbouwpercentage** | Annual accrual rate (1.5-1.875%) |
| **Eigen bijdrage** | Employee contribution (typically 3-6% of salary) |

### Calculation Example

For a salary of €60,000/year:
- Franchise (AOW offset): €17,545
- Pensionable salary: €60,000 - €17,545 = **€42,455**
- Annual accrual (1.875%): €42,455 × 1.875% = **€796/year**
- After 10 years in NL: €796 × 10 = **€7,960/year pension**
- After 20 years: **€15,920/year pension**

### New Pension System (WTP) — Coming 2027

The Netherlands is transitioning to a new pension system:

| Old System | New System (WTP) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Defined benefit (guaranteed pension) | Defined contribution (investment-based) |
| Collective risk sharing | Individual pension accounts |
| Accrual rate + franchise | Fixed contribution percentage |
| Pension amount somewhat predictable | Depends on investment returns |

**For expats:** The transition means your pension will be more transparent (you can see your individual account balance) but less predictable (returns aren't guaranteed).

## Pillar 3: Private Pension

### Tax-Advantaged Options

| Option | Annual Limit | Tax Benefit | Flexibility |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Jaarruimte** | ~€15,000 (income-dependent) | Tax-deductible contributions | Locked until retirement |
| **Lijfrente** | Same as jaarruimte | Tax-deductible | Payout as annuity |
| **Banksparen** | Same as jaarruimte | Tax-deductible | Locked until retirement |

### Jaarruimte Calculation
Your jaarruimte (annual contribution space) depends on your income and employer pension accrual:
- Formula: 30% × pensionable income - accrued pension factor
- For most employed expats: €3,000-€10,000 per year
- Calculate yours at belastingdienst.nl

### Investment Options
If you prefer flexibility over tax advantages:
- **Index funds** — Low-cost investing via DeGiro, Meesman, or Brand New Day
- **ETFs** — Broad market exposure with minimal fees
- **Savings accounts** — Low returns but zero risk

## The 30% Ruling and Your Pension

The 30% ruling significantly impacts your pension:

| Aspect | Without 30% Ruling | With 30% Ruling |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Taxable salary (€80,000) | €80,000 | €56,000 |
| Pensionable salary | €62,455 | €38,455* |
| Annual pension accrual | €1,171 | €721* |
| AOW build-up | Normal | Normal |

*Unless your employer uses your full salary as the pension base — always check!

### What to Do
1. **Ask your employer** whether pension is calculated on your full or reduced salary
2. **Negotiate** full-salary pension in your employment contract
3. **Use jaarruimte** to compensate for lower employer pension accrual
4. **Consider private investments** to fill the pension gap

## Leaving the Netherlands — What to Do

### Before You Leave
1. Download your pension overview from mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl
2. Note all your pension fund names and policy numbers
3. Apply for voluntary AOW continuation at SVB
4. Update your address with all pension funds
5. Consider whether to transfer your pension to your new country

### Value Transfer
Within the EU, you may be able to transfer your Dutch pension to a pension fund in your new country:
- Must be requested within 1 year of starting new employment
- Both pension funds must agree
- Tax implications vary — get professional advice

### Pension Payments Abroad
- AOW is paid worldwide (with possible reductions for tax treaties)
- Employer pensions are paid worldwide
- Tax treatment depends on the tax treaty between NL and your country of residence
