  - q: "How much do international schools cost in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Annual tuition fees range from €5,500 to €24,000 depending on the school and age group. Primary school fees are typically €5,500-€15,000 per year, while secondary and IB Diploma fees range from €12,000-€24,000. Additional costs include registration fees (€500-€3,000), school trips, uniforms, and lunch programs."
  - q: "Are international schools in the Netherlands subsidized?"
    a: "Some international schools receive partial Dutch government funding if they offer a bilingual Dutch-English program or are part of a regular Dutch school. Fully private international schools do not receive government subsidies. However, many employers contribute to school fees as part of expat relocation packages."
  - q: "What curriculum do international schools in the Netherlands follow?"
    a: "Most international schools offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. Some offer British A-levels, American AP curriculum, or French Baccalaureate. Many schools offer the IB Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme, and Diploma Programme for a continuous international education path."
  - q: "When should I apply to an international school in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Apply as early as possible, ideally 6-12 months before the desired start date. Popular schools in Amsterdam and The Hague have waiting lists of 1-2 years for certain age groups. Some schools accept rolling admissions, but September intake applications typically close in January-March."
  - q: "Can my child switch from an international school to a Dutch school?"
    a: "Yes, but the transition is easier at younger ages. Children under 8 typically adapt within 6-12 months. The main challenge is Dutch language proficiency. Many municipalities offer schakelklassen (transition classes) to help children learn Dutch before entering regular Dutch education."
  - q: "Do international schools teach Dutch?"
    a: "Most international schools offer Dutch as a second language, typically 2-4 hours per week. Some schools with government funding offer more intensive Dutch instruction. This helps children integrate locally while maintaining their international education."

Choosing a school is the decision that keeps my expat parent clients up at night more than anything else -- even more than housing. I get it. IB or British curriculum?

Having gone through international schooling myself as a half-British, half-Dutch kid, and now advising families on this decision regularly, I know how much it matters. Here is my guide to help you make the right call.

## Types of Curricula

### International Baccalaureate (IB) — Most Common

The IB is the most widely offered curriculum in Dutch international schools. It consists of three programs:

- **PYP** (Primary Years Programme, ages 3-12) — Inquiry-based learning across six transdisciplinary themes
- **MYP** (Middle Years Programme, ages 11-16) — Eight subject groups with global contexts
- **DP** (Diploma Programme, ages 16-18) — Rigorous pre-university qualification recognized worldwide

**Best for:** Families who may relocate again, as the IB is recognized in 150+ countries.

### British Curriculum

Several schools offer the English National Curriculum leading to IGCSEs and A-levels. This is a subject-specialist approach with external examinations.

**Best for:** Families from the UK or planning to send children to British universities.

### American Curriculum

A few schools offer the American curriculum with AP (Advanced Placement) courses and an American high school diploma.

**Best for:** American families or those planning higher education in the US.

### Bilingual Dutch-International

Some regular Dutch schools have international departments that combine the Dutch curriculum with English-language instruction. These often receive government funding, making them significantly cheaper (€0-€5,000/year).

**Best for:** Families planning to stay long-term in the Netherlands who want their children to integrate into Dutch society while maintaining an international perspective.

### 2. Apply (3-6 months before)
- Complete the application form with required documents
- Typically needed: passport copies, previous school reports, medical records, proof of address (or planned address)
- Pay the non-refundable application fee (€100-€500)

### 3. Assessment
- Most schools conduct an assessment: academic test, interview, or trial day
- For younger children, this is usually observational
- English language proficiency may be tested for non-native speakers

### 4. Acceptance and enrollment
- Accept the offer and pay the registration fee

### 5. Orientation

## Dutch Schools vs International Schools

| Factor | Dutch School | International School |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Language** | Dutch | English (+ Dutch as second language) |
| **Cost** | Free (government-funded) | €5,500-€24,000/year |
| **Curriculum** | Dutch national | IB, British, or American |
| **Integration** | Full Dutch immersion | International community |
| **Class size** | 25-30 students | 15-22 students |
| **School hours** | 8:30-15:00 | 8:30-15:30 |
| **Lunch** | Children go home or bring lunch | Usually cafeteria/provided |
| **Best for** | Long-term residents | Families who may relocate |

**Important note:** Dutch primary education starts at age 4 (group 1), earlier than many other countries. If you are moving with a 4-year-old, they can start school almost immediately.

## Tips for Choosing the Right School

1. **Visit in person** — Open days give you a feel for the school culture that websites cannot convey. Talk to other parents.

2. **Consider your timeline** — If you are staying 2-3 years, an international school keeps options open. If staying permanently, consider Dutch or bilingual schools.

3. **Check the commute** — School runs in the Netherlands are often done by bicycle. If the school is far away, factor in bus costs (€1,500-€4,000/year).

4. **Ask about support services** — Good international schools offer English language support (EAL), learning support, and counseling.

5. **Look at IB results** — Schools publish their IB Diploma pass rates and average scores. The global average is 30 points; good Dutch international schools average 33-36.

6. **Negotiate with your employer** — School fees are one of the most expensive parts of expat life. Many employers will contribute, especially in the tech sector in Amsterdam and Eindhoven.

7. **Consider after-school care** — Dutch schools end around 15:00. BSO (buitenschoolse opvang) is available but costs €400-€800/month. Some international schools offer extended day programs.

## Financial Help and Subsidies

While fully private international schools receive no government funding, there are ways to reduce costs:

- **Employer packages** — The most significant source of financial help. Always negotiate.
- **30% ruling** — If you qualify for the [30% ruling](/posts/30-percent-ruling-netherlands-2026/), your effective income is higher, making school fees more affordable.
- **Government-subsidized international departments** — Schools like AICS (Amsterdam), ISH (The Hague primary), and ISE (Eindhoven) are partly funded, with tuition of €5,000-€8,000.
- **Kinderopvangtoeslag** — Childcare subsidies (for BSO/after-school care) are available for international school children, based on income.
- **Sibling discounts** — Some schools offer 5-15% discounts for second and subsequent children.
