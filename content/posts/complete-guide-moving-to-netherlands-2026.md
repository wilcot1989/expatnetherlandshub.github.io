faq:
  - q: "How long does it take to get a BSN number in the Netherlands?"
    a: "You typically receive your BSN (Burgerservicenummer) immediately at the end of your registration appointment at the gemeente. However, booking the appointment itself can take 2-6 weeks depending on the municipality. In Amsterdam and Rotterdam, waiting times are often longer."
  - q: "Do I need a visa to move to the Netherlands as an EU citizen?"
    a: "No. EU/EEA citizens can move to the Netherlands freely and do not need a visa or work permit. You do need to register at your local municipality (gemeente) within 5 days of finding a permanent address."
  - q: "What is the 30% ruling and how do I qualify?"
    a: "The 30% ruling is a Dutch tax benefit for highly skilled migrants recruited from abroad. It allows employers to pay 30% of the employee's salary as a tax-free allowance. To qualify in 2026, you must earn a minimum taxable salary of approximately EUR 46,107 (or EUR 35,048 for those under 30 with a master's degree), be recruited from outside the Netherlands, and have specific expertise not readily available in the Dutch labor market."
  - q: "Is health insurance mandatory in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes. Everyone legally residing and working in the Netherlands must take out a basic health insurance policy (basisverzekering) within 4 months of arriving. Failure to do so results in a fine from the CAK (Central Administration Office). Read our full guide on Dutch health insurance for expats."
  - q: "How much does it cost to rent an apartment in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Rental costs vary significantly by city. In Amsterdam, expect to pay EUR 1,500-2,500 per month for a one-bedroom apartment. In cities like Utrecht, The Hague, or Eindhoven, prices are somewhat lower at EUR 1,000-1,800. Smaller cities and towns can be considerably more affordable at EUR 800-1,200."
  - q: "Can I open a Dutch bank account without a BSN?"
    a: "Traditional Dutch banks like ING, ABN AMRO, and Rabobank require a BSN to open an account. However, online banks like Wise and Bunq may allow you to start the process before receiving your BSN. We recommend setting up a Wise account before your move to handle international transfers. See our guide to the best bank accounts for expats in the Netherlands."
  - q: "What is the best time of year to move to the Netherlands?"
    a: "Spring (April-May) and early autumn (September) are ideal. The weather is milder, and the housing market tends to have slightly more availability. Avoid moving in July-August when many landlords and officials are on vacation, potentially slowing down administrative processes."

## Step 1: Determine Your Visa Type

Your visa requirements depend entirely on your nationality and the purpose of your stay.

### EU/EEA Citizens

If you hold a passport from an EU or EEA country, or from Switzerland, you have the right to live and work in the Netherlands without a visa or work permit. Simply register at your local municipality upon arrival.

### Highly Skilled Migrant Visa (Kennismigrant)

This is the most common route for non-EU professionals moving to the Netherlands for work. Your employer must be a recognized sponsor (erkend referent) with the IND (Immigration and Naturalisation Service). Key requirements in 2026:

- **Minimum salary**: Approximately EUR 5,008 per month (gross, excluding holiday allowance) for applicants aged 30 and over, or EUR 3,672 for those under 30
- **Employer sponsorship**: Your employer handles most of the application process
- **Processing time**: Usually 2-4 weeks after the employer submits the application

### The 30% Ruling

The 30% ruling is a significant tax benefit available to highly skilled migrants. Under this arrangement, 30% of your gross salary is paid as a tax-free allowance to compensate for the extra costs of living abroad. Key details for 2026:

- The ruling applies for a maximum of 5 years (reduced from the original 8 years)
- You must have been recruited from abroad (living at least 150 km from the Dutch border for at least 16 of the 24 months before your employment started)
- Minimum taxable salary requirements apply

### Other Visa Types

- **Orientation Year Visa (Zoekjaar)**: For recent graduates from Dutch or top-200 world universities, valid for 1 year
- **Startup Visa**: For entrepreneurs starting an innovative business
- **Self-Employment Visa**: For freelancers and independent professionals
- **Partner/Family Visa**: For joining a partner or family member already in the Netherlands

---

## Step 2: Find Housing

The Dutch housing market is notoriously competitive, particularly in major cities. Start your search early and be prepared to act fast.

### Where to Search

- **Funda.nl**: The largest Dutch housing platform for both rentals and purchases
- **Pararius.nl**: Focused on the rental market, popular with expats
- **Kamernet.nl**: For room rentals and shared housing
- **Facebook groups**: Many cities have expat housing groups
- **Housing agencies**: Consider a relocation agent, especially if your employer provides a relocation budget

### Tips for Finding Housing

1. **Budget 30-40% of your net income** for rent
2. **Watch out for scams**: Never transfer money before viewing a property in person or via a verified video call
3. **Prepare your documents**: Employer contract, salary slips, ID, and sometimes a reference from a previous landlord
4. **Consider living outside the Randstad**: Cities like Eindhoven, Groningen, and Maastricht offer more affordable housing with excellent quality of life
5. **Understand your rights**: Dutch tenant protection laws are strong, especially for properties in the regulated sector (sociale huur)

---

## Step 3: Register at Your Municipality (Gemeente)

Registration at your local municipality is the single most important administrative step when you arrive. This is how you receive your **BSN (Burgerservicenummer)**, the citizen service number that you need for virtually everything in the Netherlands.

### What You Need

- Valid passport or EU identity card
- Proof of address (rental contract)
- Birth certificate (apostilled and sometimes translated into Dutch or English, depending on the municipality)
- Marriage certificate (if applicable)

### How to Register

1. **Book an appointment** at your local gemeente as soon as you have a confirmed address. Waiting times can be several weeks in large cities, so book immediately.
2. **Attend the appointment** in person with all required documents.
3. **Receive your BSN** at the end of the appointment (in most cases).

Your BSN is essential for opening a bank account, getting health insurance, receiving your salary, and filing taxes.

---

## Step 4: Get Health Insurance

Health insurance is **mandatory** for everyone living and working in the Netherlands. You must arrange a basisverzekering (basic health insurance) within 4 months of registration.

The basic package is standardized by the government and covers essential medical care, including GP visits, hospital care, prescription medication, and mental health care. Premiums in 2026 range from approximately EUR 140-175 per month.

You can also opt for supplementary insurance (aanvullende verzekering) for things like dental care, physiotherapy, and alternative medicine.

For a detailed breakdown of Dutch insurers, coverage options, and how to choose the right policy, read our [complete guide to Dutch health insurance for expats](/posts/dutch-health-insurance-guide-expats-2026/).

### Temporary Coverage Before Registration

If you have just arrived and are not yet eligible for Dutch health insurance, or if you are waiting for your BSN, consider temporary international health coverage through [SafetyWing]({{safetywing_link}}). SafetyWing offers flexible monthly plans designed for expats and digital nomads, starting from around USD 45 per month. It provides solid coverage while you sort out your Dutch registration.

---

## Step 5: Open a Bank Account

You will need a Dutch bank account (or at least an IBAN) to receive your salary, pay rent, and handle everyday transactions. The Netherlands is very much a card-and-app-based payment society.

### Recommended First Step: Wise

Before you even leave your home country, set up a [Wise account]({{wise_link}}). Wise (formerly TransferWise) gives you a multi-currency account with a Dutch IBAN, which is incredibly useful during the transition period. You can:

- Receive your first salary before opening a traditional Dutch bank account
- Transfer money between countries at the real exchange rate with low fees
- Hold and convert over 50 currencies
- Pay with a Wise debit card anywhere in the Netherlands

Once you have your BSN, you can open an account at a traditional Dutch bank like ING, ABN AMRO, or Rabobank, or stay with a modern bank like Bunq or N26. For a full comparison, see our guide to the [best bank accounts for expats in the Netherlands](/posts/best-bank-account-expats-netherlands-2026/).

## Step 6: Get a Dutch Phone Number and SIM Card

A Dutch phone number is essential for setting up accounts, receiving verification codes, and everyday communication. The main mobile providers are:

- **KPN**: Largest network, best coverage
- **T-Mobile (Odido)**: Rebranded in the Netherlands, competitive pricing
- **Vodafone**: Good coverage and international options
- **Budget options**: Simpel, Lebara, Ben, and Lycamobile for prepaid SIM cards

You can buy a prepaid SIM card at Mediamarkt, phone stores, or supermarkets. If you plan to stay long-term, a contract (abonnement) usually offers better value.

### Protect Your Online Privacy

When settling into a new country, you are likely signing up for dozens of new services and sharing personal information across many platforms. A VPN is a smart investment for protecting your privacy, especially when using public Wi-Fi at cafes, trains, or coworking spaces. [NordVPN]({{nordvpn_link}}) is our recommended choice for expats in the Netherlands, offering fast speeds, servers in over 60 countries, and the ability to access content from your home country when needed.

---

## Step 7: Set Up Transportation

The Netherlands has one of the best public transportation systems in Europe, and cycling is a way of life.

### OV-Chipkaart and OVpay

The **OV-chipkaart** is the standard public transport card used on all trains, buses, trams, and metros. You can order a personal OV-chipkaart (linked to your name, required for subscriptions and discounts) or buy an anonymous one at any station.

As of 2026, **OVpay** also allows you to tap in and out with your contactless debit or credit card or phone, making it even easier for newcomers.

### Popular Transport Subscriptions

- **NS Flex**: For frequent train travelers, offering off-peak discounts of 40%
- **Dal Voordeel**: 40% discount on off-peak train travel for EUR 5.10 per month
- **Weekend Vrij**: Unlimited weekend train travel

### Get a Bike

This is the Netherlands, and cycling is not optional. It is the primary mode of transport for millions of Dutch people. Buy a second-hand bike on Marktplaats.nl (the Dutch equivalent of Craigslist), visit a local bike shop, or use Swapfiets for a monthly bike rental subscription.

---

## Step 8: Apply for DigiD

**DigiD** is your digital identity for interacting with Dutch government services online. You need it for filing taxes, managing health insurance subsidies (zorgtoeslag), and accessing many municipal services.

To apply:
1. Go to digid.nl
2. Enter your BSN and personal details
3. Receive an activation code by post (takes about 5 business days)
4. Activate your DigiD account

We strongly recommend setting up DigiD as soon as you have your BSN. You will need it frequently.

---

## Step 9: Understand the Tax System

The Dutch tax system can be complex, especially for expats. Key points to know:

- **Income tax** is progressive, with rates ranging from approximately 36.97% to 49.50% in 2026
- **The 30% ruling** significantly reduces your effective tax rate if you qualify
- **Tax returns** are filed annually by May 1 for the previous year
- **Zorgtoeslag** (healthcare allowance) may be available if your income is below a certain threshold
- **Huurtoeslag** (rent allowance) may apply if you rent in the regulated sector

Consider hiring a tax advisor who specializes in expat taxation, especially in your first year.

## Step 10: Start Learning Dutch

While the Netherlands is famous for its high level of English proficiency, learning Dutch will dramatically improve your experience. It helps with:

- Reading official correspondence and documents
- Building deeper connections with Dutch colleagues and neighbors
- Understanding cultural nuances
- Navigating situations where English is less common (hospitals, government offices, smaller towns)

Check out our [guide to the 7 best apps for learning Dutch in 2026](/posts/best-apps-learn-dutch-2026/) to find the right tool for your learning style.

Many municipalities also offer free or subsidized Dutch language courses (inburgering) for newcomers. Ask your gemeente about available programs.

## Practical Tips from Experienced Expats

1. **Bring apostilled documents**: Birth certificates, marriage certificates, and diplomas should be apostilled in your home country before you move. Getting this done later is much more difficult.

2. **Set realistic expectations for housing**: The housing market is tight. Be flexible on location and be ready to decide quickly when you find something suitable.

3. **Build your social network early**: Join expat groups, attend meetups, and consider joining a sports club (vereniging). The Dutch social scene often revolves around clubs and organized activities.

4. **Get used to directness**: Dutch communication is famously direct. It is not rudeness; it is cultural. You will come to appreciate the clarity.

5. **Embrace the weather**: It rains. A lot. Invest in a good rain jacket and waterproof bag for your bike, and you will be fine.

6. **Use Tikkie**: This payment request app is the social norm for splitting bills among friends. Download it immediately.

## Final Thoughts

Moving to the Netherlands is a big step, but the country rewards those who make the effort. With excellent infrastructure, a strong economy, a central European location, and a welcoming (if sometimes blunt) culture, it is a fantastic place to build a new chapter.

The key to a smooth transition is preparation. Handle your visa and housing early, register at your gemeente as soon as possible, and set up your essential services, banking, insurance, phone, and transport, in the first two weeks.

For banking, start with [Wise]({{wise_link}}) before you arrive. For temporary health coverage, consider [SafetyWing]({{safetywing_link}}) until your Dutch insurance kicks in. And protect your digital life with [NordVPN]({{nordvpn_link}}) from day one.

Welcome to the Netherlands. Welkom in Nederland.
