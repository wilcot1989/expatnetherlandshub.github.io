faq:
  - q: "Is health insurance mandatory in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes. Everyone who legally lives or works in the Netherlands is required by law to have a basic health insurance policy (basisverzekering). You must arrange this within 4 months of your registration date. If you fail to do so, the CAK (Central Administration Office) will assign you a policy and you may face a fine."
  - q: "How much does Dutch health insurance cost in 2026?"
    a: "Basic health insurance (basisverzekering) premiums in 2026 range from approximately EUR 140 to EUR 175 per month depending on the insurer. On top of this, you pay an annual own risk (eigen risico) of EUR 385 for most treatments beyond GP visits. Supplementary insurance (aanvullende verzekering) adds EUR 10-80 per month depending on coverage."
  - q: "What is the eigen risico and how does it work?"
    a: "The eigen risico (own risk or deductible) is a mandatory annual amount of EUR 385 in 2026 that you pay out of pocket before your insurance covers certain treatments. It applies to specialist care, hospital visits, prescription medication, and mental healthcare. It does NOT apply to GP visits, maternity care, or care for children under 18. You can choose to increase your eigen risico to up to EUR 885 in exchange for a lower monthly premium."
  - q: "What is zorgtoeslag and am I eligible?"
    a: "Zorgtoeslag is a monthly healthcare allowance from the Dutch government to help lower-income residents afford health insurance. Eligibility depends on your income and assets. In 2026, single individuals earning below approximately EUR 38,520 and couples earning below approximately EUR 48,224 may qualify. The maximum allowance is approximately EUR 130 per month. You need a DigiD to apply via toeslagen.nl."
  - q: "Can I keep my home country health insurance in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Generally no. If you are employed or self-employed in the Netherlands, Dutch law requires you to take out Dutch basic health insurance, even if you have insurance from another country. There are limited exceptions: posted workers covered by their home country's social security system, and certain cross-border workers. If in doubt, check with the SVB (Social Insurance Bank)."
  - q: "What does Dutch basic health insurance cover?"
    a: "The basisverzekering covers a comprehensive package defined by the government, including: GP care, hospital care, specialist medical care, prescription medication, mental healthcare (with referral), maternity and obstetric care, ambulance transport, dental care for children under 18, physiotherapy (limited sessions for chronic conditions), and medical devices. Dental care for adults and extensive physiotherapy require supplementary insurance."
  - q: "When can I switch health insurance providers in the Netherlands?"
    a: "You can switch your basic health insurance provider once per year during the open enrollment period, which runs from mid-November to December 31. Your new policy starts on January 1 of the following year. You do not need to give a reason for switching, and the new insurer must accept you regardless of your health status. Supplementary insurance can be switched at the same time, but the new insurer may reject your supplementary application based on health screening."

Dutch health insurance confused me more than almost anything else when I first moved here. Basisverzekering, eigen risico, zorgtoeslag -- the terminology alone is enough to make your head spin. And then you find out it is mandatory and you have only four months to sort it out. After navigating the system myself and helping hundreds of clients choose the right policy, I can tell you it is actually one of the best healthcare setups in the world. You just need to know how it works.

## The Basisverzekering: Your Mandatory Basic Insurance

The basisverzekering (basic insurance) is the foundation of Dutch healthcare. Every person who legally resides or works in the Netherlands must have one. There are no exceptions based on age, health status, or nationality.

### What It Covers

The basic package is defined by the Dutch government and is identical across all insurers. This means no matter which insurer you choose, the basic coverage is the same. It includes:

- **GP (huisarts) care**: Fully covered with no eigen risico applied
- **Hospital and specialist care**: Covered after eigen risico
- **Prescription medication**: Covered after eigen risico (for medications on the approved list)
- **Mental healthcare**: Covered with GP referral, after eigen risico
- **Maternity care**: Fully covered, including prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal home care
- **Ambulance and emergency transport**: Covered after eigen risico
- **Physiotherapy**: Limited coverage for chronic conditions (from the 21st session onward, or from the 1st session for conditions on the chronic list)
- **Medical devices and prosthetics**: Covered as specified
- **Dental care for children under 18**: Fully covered
- **Smoking cessation support**: Covered once per year

### What It Does NOT Cover

- **Dental care for adults**: Requires supplementary insurance or out-of-pocket payment
- **Physiotherapy for non-chronic conditions**: Not covered under basic insurance
- **Alternative medicine**: Homeopathy, acupuncture (unless specified for certain conditions), etc.
- **Cosmetic procedures**: Unless medically necessary
- **Glasses and contact lenses**: Requires supplementary insurance
- **Extensive mental healthcare** beyond the covered sessions

## Choosing Your Insurer

While the basic coverage is the same everywhere, there are differences between insurers that matter:

### The Main Dutch Health Insurers

| Insurer | Brands | Market Share | Monthly Premium (approx.) | English Support | Key Strength |
|---------|--------|-------------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Zilveren Kruis** | Zilveren Kruis, Interpolis | Largest | EUR 145-155 | Good | Largest network, most contracted care |
| **CZ** | CZ, Just, Nationale-Nederlanden | Large | EUR 140-150 | Moderate | Competitive pricing, good digital tools |
| **VGZ** | VGZ, Univé, UMC | Large | EUR 145-155 | Moderate | Strong supplementary packages |
| **Menzis** | Menzis, Anderzorg | Mid-size | EUR 140-150 | Limited | Often competitive on price |

### How to Choose: What Matters

1. **Premium**: Premiums vary by approximately EUR 20-35 per month between the cheapest and most expensive option for the same basic coverage. Over a year, this adds up.

2. **Contracted care (gecontracteerde zorg)**: Insurers negotiate contracts with hospitals, specialists, and therapists. If you use contracted providers, your care is fully covered (after eigen risico). If you use non-contracted providers, the insurer may only reimburse a percentage (typically 60-80%). Larger insurers like Zilveren Kruis tend to have the widest networks.

3. **Supplementary insurance options**: If you need dental, physiotherapy, or alternative medicine coverage, compare the supplementary packages offered by each insurer.

4. **Collectiviteitskorting (group discount)**: Many employers, unions, and organizations offer group health insurance discounts. Check with your employer if they have a collective agreement with a specific insurer, which can save you 5-10% on your premium.

5. **Customer service**: Check reviews for claim handling speed, app quality, and responsiveness.

## The Eigen Risico Explained

The eigen risico (own risk) is the Dutch equivalent of a deductible. In 2026, the mandatory amount is **EUR 385 per year**.

### How It Works

- Each calendar year, you pay the first EUR 385 of covered care costs out of your own pocket
- After reaching EUR 385, your insurer covers everything for the rest of the year
- The counter resets to zero on January 1

### What Counts Toward Your Eigen Risico

- Specialist consultations and treatments
- Hospital stays and procedures
- Prescription medication
- Mental healthcare sessions
- Ambulance transport

### What Does NOT Count

- GP visits (huisarts)
- Maternity and obstetric care
- Care for children under 18
- Certain preventive screenings

### Voluntary Higher Eigen Risico

You can choose to increase your eigen risico by EUR 100, 200, 300, or 500 (to a maximum of EUR 885) in exchange for a lower monthly premium. This makes sense if you are young, healthy, and rarely visit specialists. However, if you do need care, you will pay more out of pocket.

**Our advice for new expats**: Stick with the standard EUR 385 eigen risico in your first year. You do not yet know the Dutch healthcare system, and unexpected medical needs can arise during a stressful relocation period.

## Aanvullende Verzekering: Supplementary Insurance

Supplementary insurance (aanvullende verzekering) covers what the basisverzekering does not. Unlike basic insurance, supplementary coverage differs between insurers and they can reject your application based on health questionnaires.

### Common Supplementary Coverage

| Coverage Type | Typical Cost | What It Covers |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Dental (tandarts)** | EUR 10-40/month | Checkups, fillings, crowns, sometimes orthodontics |
| **Physiotherapy** | EUR 5-25/month | Sessions beyond basic coverage |
| **Alternative medicine** | EUR 5-15/month | Acupuncture, homeopathy, osteopathy |
| **Glasses/contacts** | EUR 5-15/month | Allowance toward lenses, frames |
| **Abroad coverage** | EUR 5-20/month | Extended coverage for travel outside the Netherlands |
| **Comprehensive packages** | EUR 20-80/month | Bundles of multiple supplementary coverages |

### Do You Need Supplementary Insurance?

**Consider it if you**:
- Need regular dental care (adults)
- Want physiotherapy for non-chronic conditions
- Use alternative medicine
- Wear glasses or contacts and want partial reimbursement
- Travel frequently outside Europe

**You may skip it if you**:
- Are young and healthy with no regular healthcare needs beyond GP visits
- Have good dental health and minimal specialist needs
- Prefer to pay out-of-pocket for occasional dental visits (a basic cleaning costs approximately EUR 30-50, a filling EUR 50-100)

## Zorgtoeslag: Getting Money Back

Zorgtoeslag is a monthly government allowance designed to help people on lower and moderate incomes afford health insurance. As an expat, you may be eligible, especially in your first partial year when your annual income may be lower.

### Eligibility Criteria (2026 Approximate)

- **Single**: Annual income below approximately EUR 38,520
- **Couple**: Combined annual income below approximately EUR 48,224
- **Assets**: Below approximately EUR 130,000 (single) or EUR 260,000 (couple), excluding your primary home
- **Age**: 18 or older
- **Insurance**: You must have Dutch basic health insurance

### How to Apply

1. Register for a **DigiD** at digid.nl (you need your BSN)
2. Go to **toeslagen.nl** (part of the Belastingdienst / Dutch Tax Authority)
3. Submit your application with income and personal details
4. Receive monthly payments directly to your bank account

The maximum zorgtoeslag in 2026 is approximately EUR 130 per month for a single person. The actual amount decreases as your income increases.

**Important**: Apply as soon as you have your DigiD. Zorgtoeslag can be claimed retroactively, but only up to a certain period. Do not leave money on the table.

---

## The 4-Month Deadline: What Happens If You Are Late?

When you register at your gemeente and receive your BSN, a 4-month countdown begins. You must have basisverzekering arranged within this period.

If you miss the deadline:

1. **The CAK sends a warning letter** informing you that you are uninsured
2. **If you remain uninsured after 3 months**, the CAK issues a fine (approximately EUR 469 in 2026)
3. **If still uninsured**, the CAK will assign you to an insurer and start deducting premiums from your salary or benefits

Do not let this happen. Arrange your insurance within the first few weeks of arriving. It is straightforward and all major insurers have English-language sign-up processes.

## Temporary Coverage: Before Your Dutch Insurance Starts

There is often a gap between arriving in the Netherlands and getting your Dutch health insurance set up. You might be waiting for your BSN, comparing insurers, or simply dealing with the chaos of relocation.

During this period, [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=26482728&utm_source=26482728&utm_medium=Ambassador) offers an excellent temporary solution. SafetyWing provides international health insurance designed for expats and digital nomads, with the following features:

[SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=26482728&utm_source=26482728&utm_medium=Ambassador) is not a replacement for Dutch basisverzekering. Once you are registered and have arranged your Dutch health insurance, you should cancel SafetyWing. But as bridge coverage, it provides genuine peace of mind during the transition period.

This is especially relevant for:
- Expats who arrive a few weeks before their employment start date

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Dutch Health Insurance

Here is the complete process from arrival to being fully insured:

### Week 1: Arrival and Registration

1. Register at your gemeente and receive your BSN
2. If you do not yet have coverage, sign up for [SafetyWing](https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=26482728&utm_source=26482728&utm_medium=Ambassador) as temporary insurance

### Week 2-3: Research and Compare

3. Use <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=8558&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Independer.nl</a> or Zorgwijzer.nl to compare basic insurance premiums
4. Check if your employer offers a group discount (collectiviteitskorting) with a specific insurer
5. Decide whether you need supplementary insurance (dental, physiotherapy, etc.)

### Week 3-4: Sign Up

6. Apply online with your chosen insurer (you will need your BSN, Dutch address, and Dutch bank account or IBAN)
7. Set up the monthly direct debit (automatische incasso) from your bank account
8. Receive your insurance confirmation and policy number

### After Insurance Starts

9. Register with a GP (huisarts) near your home. You will need your insurance details for this.
10. Apply for zorgtoeslag via toeslagen.nl if your income qualifies
11. Cancel your temporary SafetyWing coverage

## How to Register with a GP (Huisarts)

In the Netherlands, the GP (huisarts) is your medical gatekeeper. You cannot see a specialist, go to the hospital (except emergencies), or access mental healthcare without a referral from your GP.

### How to Find and Register

1. Search for GP practices near your home on Zorgkaartnederland.nl
2. Call or visit the practice to ask if they accept new patients (many popular practices have full patient lists)
3. Bring your insurance details and ID
4. Complete a registration form

**Tip**: Register with a GP as soon as you have your health insurance. In popular neighborhoods, especially in Amsterdam and other large cities, many GPs have waiting lists. Do not wait until you are sick to find one.

---

## Special Situations

### Expats with the 30% Ruling

The 30% ruling does not affect your health insurance requirements. You must still take out basisverzekering. However, because the ruling reduces your taxable income, you may qualify for zorgtoeslag even on a relatively high gross salary.

### Self-Employed Expats (ZZP)

If you are self-employed (ZZP'er) in the Netherlands, you must arrange your own health insurance. There is no employer contribution. Your premiums are tax-deductible as a business expense. Carefully compare policies, as the full cost comes out of your own pocket.

### Students

International students in the Netherlands who also work (even part-time) are generally required to have Dutch health insurance. If you only study and do not work, you may be exempt. Check with your university's international office for guidance specific to your situation.

### Children

Children under 18 are covered free of charge under their parent's basic insurance. They have no separate premium and no eigen risico. Dental care is included in their basic coverage.

---

## Common Mistakes Expats Make

1. **Waiting too long to arrange insurance**: Start the process in your first week, not your fourth month.

2. **Choosing the cheapest premium without checking the network**: A low premium means nothing if your preferred hospital or specialist is not in the insurer's contracted network.

3. **Ignoring supplementary dental insurance**: A single root canal treatment can cost EUR 500-1,000 out of pocket. If you have any ongoing dental needs, supplementary dental insurance is usually worth it.

4. **Forgetting to apply for zorgtoeslag**: Free money that many expats do not claim simply because they do not know about it.

5. **Not registering with a GP immediately**: When you get sick, it is too late to find a GP with an open patient list.

6. **Assuming home country insurance is sufficient**: In almost all cases, Dutch law requires Dutch basisverzekering, regardless of what other insurance you hold.

## Final Thoughts

Dutch health insurance may seem complicated at first, but the system is logical once you understand its components. The basisverzekering provides a strong foundation of coverage that is the same regardless of which insurer you choose. Your main decisions are: which insurer offers the best premium and network for your situation, whether you need supplementary coverage, and whether to adjust your eigen risico.

For expats just arriving, the most important steps are:

1. Get temporary coverage through <a href="https://safetywing.com/nomad-insurance/?referenceID=26482728&utm_source=26482728&utm_medium=Ambassador" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">SafetyWing</a> if there will be any gap before your Dutch insurance starts
2. Compare policies on <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=8558&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Independer.nl</a> once you have your BSN
3. Sign up within your first few weeks, well before the 4-month deadline
4. Register with a GP immediately after your insurance is active
5. Apply for zorgtoeslag if your income qualifies

The Dutch healthcare system is excellent. Once you are set up, you will have access to high-quality, affordable care that covers virtually all your medical needs. Take the time to get it right from the start, and it will serve you well throughout your time in the Netherlands.
