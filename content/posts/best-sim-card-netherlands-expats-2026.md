faq:
  - q: "Can I buy a SIM card in the Netherlands without a BSN?"
    a: "Yes. You can buy a prepaid SIM card at supermarkets, electronics stores, or provider shops without a BSN. However, since September 2023, Dutch regulations require identity verification for prepaid SIMs, so you will need to show a valid passport or ID. For postpaid contracts, most providers require a BSN and a Dutch bank account."
  - q: "Which Dutch mobile network has the best coverage?"
    a: "KPN consistently ranks first for network coverage in the Netherlands, particularly in rural areas. T-Mobile (Odido) has invested heavily in 5G and comes a close second. Vodafone offers solid coverage in urban areas. Budget providers like Simyo and Ben use the KPN network, so they offer the same coverage at a lower price."
  - q: "Do Dutch SIM cards work in other EU countries?"
    a: "Yes. Under EU roaming regulations, you can use your Dutch SIM card in all EU and EEA countries at no extra cost, using your plan's included data, minutes, and texts. However, there is a fair use policy, meaning providers may limit roaming data if you consistently use more data abroad than in the Netherlands."
  - q: "What is the cheapest mobile plan in the Netherlands for expats?"
    a: "For the absolute lowest cost, Lebara and Lyca Mobile offer prepaid bundles starting from around EUR 5-10 per month with modest data. Among contract plans, Simyo and Ben offer packages from around EUR 7-10 per month. If you need more data, T-Mobile and Simyo offer competitive mid-range plans between EUR 15-25 per month."
  - q: "Can I keep my home country phone number when I move to the Netherlands?"
    a: "You cannot port a non-Dutch number to a Dutch provider. However, you can keep your old SIM active alongside your Dutch SIM using a dual-SIM phone or an eSIM. Many expats use their Dutch number for daily life and keep their home number active for banking verification or staying in touch with family."
  - q: "Do Dutch providers offer eSIM?"
    a: "Yes. KPN, T-Mobile (Odido), and Vodafone all offer eSIM for both prepaid and contract plans. This is particularly convenient for expats with dual-SIM phones, as you can keep your home country physical SIM while using a Dutch eSIM. Some budget providers like Simyo have also started offering eSIM in 2026."
  - q: "How long does a Dutch phone contract last?"
    a: "Dutch phone contracts are available in 1-month (flex), 1-year, and 2-year terms. After the initial term, contracts automatically convert to a monthly rolling agreement that you can cancel with one month's notice. Since 2024, Dutch law makes it easy to switch providers, and your number is ported within one business day."

Getting a Dutch phone number is one of the first things you need to sort out when you arrive in the Netherlands. You need it for everything from setting up a bank account and receiving verification codes to registering for DigiD and joining the local WhatsApp groups that make up so much of Dutch social life.

But with seven major providers and dozens of plan types, choosing the right SIM card can be confusing, especially when websites are mostly in Dutch. This guide cuts through the noise and compares every major option available to expats in 2026.

## Prepaid vs. Contract: Which Should You Choose?

This is the first decision you need to make, and it depends on your situation.

### Prepaid (Prepaid SIM)

**Best for**: Newly arrived expats, short-term stays, those without a BSN yet.

- No BSN or Dutch bank account required (just an ID for verification)
- No credit check or commitment
- Buy at supermarkets (Albert Heijn, Jumbo), electronics stores (Mediamarkt, Coolblue), or provider shops
- Top up as needed or buy monthly bundles
- Generally more expensive per GB than contracts

### Contract (Abonnement)

**Best for**: Expats planning to stay 6 months or longer.

- Requires a BSN and a Dutch bank account (IBAN)
- Better value per GB, especially for higher data usage
- Available in 1-month flex, 1-year, or 2-year terms
- May include a subsidized phone with 2-year contracts
- Often includes more EU roaming data

### Our Recommendation

Start with a **prepaid SIM from Lebara or Simyo** when you first arrive. Once you have your BSN and a Dutch bank account (see our guide to the [best bank accounts for expats](/posts/best-bank-account-expats-netherlands-2026/)), switch to a **contract plan from Simyo or T-Mobile** for better long-term value.

## The Big Three: Premium Providers

### KPN

KPN is the largest and oldest telecom provider in the Netherlands. If you live or travel in rural areas, KPN offers the most reliable coverage.

**Pros:**
- Best overall network coverage, including rural areas
- Strong 5G rollout in major cities
- eSIM available for all plans
- English-language customer service available
- Extensive network of physical stores

**Cons:**
- Most expensive of the three major providers

- Website and app are primarily in Dutch (though English is available)

**Plans (2026):**
- 5 GB: ~EUR 20/month
- 15 GB: ~EUR 30/month
- Unlimited: ~EUR 40-45/month

**Best for**: Expats who live outside the Randstad or need maximum coverage reliability.

### T-Mobile Netherlands (Odido)

T-Mobile has rebranded to Odido in the Netherlands, though both names are still commonly used. They have made significant 5G investments and often offer the most competitive pricing among the big three.

**Pros:**
- Most aggressive 5G rollout in the Netherlands
- Competitive pricing, often EUR 2-5 cheaper than KPN for comparable plans
- Good English-language support
- eSIM support
- Frequent promotional discounts for new customers

**Cons:**

**Best for**: Expats in cities who want fast 5G at a fair price.

### Vodafone

Vodafone is the third major provider and positions itself between KPN and T-Mobile in both price and coverage.

**Pros:**
- Good international calling bundles (useful for expats calling home)
- Solid coverage in urban and suburban areas
- eSIM support
- Vodafone Passport add-on for non-EU roaming
- English-language support available

**Plans (2026):**
- 5 GB: ~EUR 18/month
- 15 GB: ~EUR 28/month
- Unlimited: ~EUR 38-40/month

**Best for**: Expats who frequently call non-EU countries and want a simple international add-on.

## Budget Providers: Best Value for Expats

Budget providers (also called MVNOs) do not own their own networks. Instead, they lease capacity from KPN, T-Mobile, or Vodafone. This means you get the same coverage at a significantly lower price, with the trade-off being less customer support and fewer physical stores.

### Simyo (KPN Network)

**Our top pick for budget-conscious expats on a contract.**

Simyo runs on the KPN network, giving you the best coverage in the Netherlands at budget prices. Their plans are straightforward, and they were one of the first budget providers to offer eSIM.

- 2 GB: ~EUR 7/month
- 5 GB: ~EUR 10/month
- 10 GB: ~EUR 15/month
- 20 GB: ~EUR 20/month
- Flex contracts available (cancel monthly)
- eSIM available since late 2025

**Why we like it**: KPN coverage at nearly half the price. The flex contracts mean no long-term commitment.

### Lebara (KPN Network)

**Our top pick for new arrivals and international callers.**

Lebara has long been the go-to choice for expats and immigrants. They specialize in affordable international calling rates and offer prepaid plans that do not require a BSN.

- 1 GB: ~EUR 5/month
- 5 GB: ~EUR 10/month
- 10 GB: ~EUR 15/month
- 20 GB: ~EUR 25/month
- Cheap international calling to 50+ countries included in most bundles
- Prepaid SIMs available at many supermarkets

**Why we like it**: Easy to get started without a BSN, great international call rates, and the KPN network underneath.

### Ben (KPN Network)

Ben is a no-nonsense budget provider on the KPN network. Their plans are simple, and they focus on delivering basic service at a low price.

- 2 GB: ~EUR 8/month
- 5 GB: ~EUR 12/month
- 10 GB: ~EUR 17/month
- 15 GB: ~EUR 22/month
- SIM-only contracts from 1 month

**Why we like it**: Extremely simple pricing on the KPN network. Good for expats who just want a basic plan without any frills.

### Lyca Mobile (T-Mobile Network)

Lyca Mobile is similar to Lebara in targeting expats and immigrants, with a focus on cheap international calls. They run on the T-Mobile network.

- 1 GB: ~EUR 5/month
- 5 GB: ~EUR 10/month
- 10 GB: ~EUR 15/month
- 15 GB: ~EUR 20/month
- Very cheap international calling rates
- Prepaid SIMs widely available

**Why we like it**: The cheapest international calls in many cases, and easy prepaid activation.

## eSIM: The Modern Option for Expats

If your phone supports eSIM (most phones released after 2020 do), this is arguably the best option for expats. An eSIM is a digital SIM card that you activate by scanning a QR code, with no physical SIM card needed.

### Why eSIM is Great for Expats

1. **Dual SIM capability**: Keep your home country's physical SIM in one slot and use a Dutch eSIM in the other. This means you can receive calls and texts on your old number while using your Dutch number for daily life.
2. **Instant activation**: No need to visit a shop. Order online and activate within minutes.
3. **Easy to switch**: If you leave the Netherlands, simply deactivate your Dutch eSIM and add a new one for your next country.

### Providers Offering eSIM in 2026

- **KPN**: eSIM available for prepaid and contract
- **T-Mobile (Odido)**: eSIM available for all plans
- **Vodafone**: eSIM for contract plans
- **Simyo**: eSIM launched in late 2025

For budget eSIM options that work across multiple countries, you can also look at international eSIM providers like Airalo or Holafly, though these are better suited for travel rather than long-term Dutch residence.

## EU Roaming: What You Need to Know

Since 2017, EU roaming regulation means you can use your Dutch SIM card throughout the EU and EEA at no extra cost. This is a significant benefit for expats who travel frequently within Europe.

### Key Rules

- You use your Dutch included data, minutes, and texts when roaming in the EU/EEA
- There is a **fair use policy**: if you consistently use more data abroad than in the Netherlands, your provider may charge a small surcharge (currently around EUR 1.55 per GB)
- Switzerland is **not** included in EU roaming (some providers offer it as an add-on)
- The UK is **not** included post-Brexit (most providers charge extra or offer UK add-ons)

### Best for Frequent Travelers

If you regularly travel to other EU countries, T-Mobile and Vodafone tend to offer the most generous roaming allowances, often matching your full Dutch data bundle for EU roaming.

## Saving Money on Your Dutch Phone Plan

Here are practical strategies to reduce your mobile costs.

### 1. Use WiFi Calling

The Netherlands has excellent WiFi coverage in homes, offices, cafes, and even public transport. All major providers support WiFi calling, reducing your need for a large data plan.

### 2. Start with a Small Plan

Data needs in the Netherlands may be lower than you expect, thanks to widespread WiFi. Start with a 5 GB plan and upgrade later if needed.

### 3. Consider a SIM-Only Flex Contract

If you already have an unlocked phone, a SIM-only flex contract from Simyo or Ben gives you the best per-GB value with no commitment.

### 4. Check for Expat Promotions

T-Mobile and Vodafone occasionally run promotions targeting new customers, including extra data for the first few months. Check vergelijken.nl (the Dutch comparison site) for current deals.

### 5. Bundle with Internet

If you also need home internet, some providers offer discounts when you bundle mobile and broadband. KPN and T-Mobile both offer combination discounts.

## Protecting Your Privacy Online

As a newly arrived expat, you are creating accounts on dozens of new platforms, often on unfamiliar public WiFi networks in hotels, coworking spaces, and cafes. Protecting your digital privacy is important. A VPN encrypts your internet connection and can also let you access streaming content from your home country.

We recommend [NordVPN]({{nordvpn_link}}) for expats in the Netherlands. Read our full [VPN guide for expats in the Netherlands](/posts/best-vpn-netherlands-expats-2026/) for detailed comparisons.
