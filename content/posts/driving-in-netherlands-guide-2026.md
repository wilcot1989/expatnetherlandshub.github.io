faq:
  - q: "Can I drive with my foreign license in the Netherlands?"
    a: "EU/EEA licenses are valid indefinitely. Non-EU licenses are valid for 185 days after registration. After that, you must exchange your license (if your country has an agreement) or take the Dutch driving exam. Some countries (USA, Canada, Japan, South Korea) have exchange agreements."
  - q: "How do I exchange my driver's license in the Netherlands?"
    a: "If your country has an exchange agreement with the Netherlands: apply at your municipality (gemeente), submit your foreign license, ID, and recent passport photo, pay approximately €40, and receive your Dutch license within 1-4 weeks. If no agreement exists, you must take the Dutch driving exam."
  - q: "How much does it cost to own a car in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Monthly costs average €400-€700 including: insurance (€50-€150), road tax (€30-€100), fuel (€150-€250), maintenance (€50-€100), and parking (€50-€200 in cities). The Netherlands is one of the most expensive countries in Europe for car ownership due to high taxes."
  - q: "Do I need a car in the Netherlands?"
    a: "In most Dutch cities, no. Public transport, cycling, and car-sharing cover most needs. A car is useful if you live in rural areas, have a long commute not served by public transport, have small children, or frequently travel to areas outside the Randstad."
  - q: "What are the main differences in Dutch driving rules?"
    a: "Key differences: cyclists have priority in most situations, right has priority at unmarked intersections, speed limits are strictly enforced by cameras, the maximum alcohol limit is 0.5‰ (0.2‰ for new drivers), and winter tires are not mandatory but recommended."
  - q: "Is an electric car worth it in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes, electric cars have significant tax advantages in the Netherlands: no road tax (BPM), lower bijtelling (company car tax), free or discounted parking in many cities, and lower fuel costs. With dense charging infrastructure and short distances, the Netherlands is ideal for EVs."

I resisted getting a car in the Netherlands for years -- the cycling is great, the trains are excellent, and owning a car here is eye-wateringly expensive. But when I started needing to visit clients outside the Randstad, I finally had to figure out Dutch driving rules, license exchange, and why everyone seems to be in a traffic jam on the A2 at the same time. Here is what I have learned.

## Driver's License: What You Need

### EU/EEA License Holders
Your EU/EEA driver's license is valid in the Netherlands. You can drive indefinitely without exchanging it. When it expires, you can renew it at your Dutch municipality.

### Non-EU License Holders

| Your Country | Exchange Possible? | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **USA** (select states) | ✅ Yes | Must exchange within 185 days |
| **Canada** | ✅ Yes | Direct exchange |
| **Japan** | ✅ Yes | Direct exchange |
| **South Korea** | ✅ Yes | Direct exchange |
| **Australia** | ❌ No | Must take Dutch exam |
| **UK** | ✅ Yes (post-Brexit agreement) | Direct exchange |
| **India** | ❌ No | Must take Dutch exam |
| **Brazil** | ❌ No | Must take Dutch exam |

### Exchange Process (If Eligible)
1. Book an appointment at your municipality (gemeente)
2. Bring: foreign license, ID/passport, residence permit, recent passport photo
3. Pay approximately €40
4. Receive your Dutch license within 1-4 weeks
5. Your foreign license is kept by the municipality

### Taking the Dutch Driving Exam
If exchange is not possible:
- **Theory exam:** €40, 65 questions, pass score 54/65, available in English
- **Practical exam:** €125, 35-minute driving test
- **Driving lessons:** €50-€70/hour, typically 20-40 lessons needed (€1,000-€2,800)
- **Total cost:** €1,200-€3,000

## Dutch Driving Rules

### Speed Limits

| Road Type | Speed Limit | Common Enforcement |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| Built-up areas (bebouwde kom) | 30-50 km/h | Speed cameras |
| Outside built-up areas | 80 km/h | Speed cameras |
| Expressways | 100 km/h | Section control |
| Motorways (daytime) | 100-130 km/h | Section control |
| Motorways (19:00-06:00) | 120-130 km/h | Section control |

**Important:** The Netherlands uses extensive speed camera networks and section control (average speed measurement over a distance). Fines start at €30 for 1-5 km/h over the limit and increase rapidly.

### Key Rules Different from Other Countries

1. **Priority from the right** — At unmarked intersections, traffic from the right has priority. This catches many expats off guard
2. **Cyclists have priority** — In most situations, cyclists and pedestrians have right of way. Always check for cyclists when turning
3. **Alcohol limit** — 0.5‰ blood alcohol limit (0.2‰ for drivers with less than 5 years experience)
4. **Phone use** — Strictly prohibited while driving. Fine: €380
5. **Roundabouts** — Traffic on the roundabout has priority (opposite of some countries)
6. **Emergency lane (vluchtstrook)** — Only for emergencies. Using it to pass is a serious offense
7. **Trams** — Trams almost always have priority

### Fines

| Violation | Fine |
|----------|------|
| 10 km/h over limit | €70-€100 |
| 20 km/h over limit | €200-€300 |
| Running a red light | €280 |
| Phone use while driving | €380 |
| No seatbelt | €170 |
| Drunk driving (0.5-0.8‰) | €550-€1,100 |
| Drunk driving (>0.8‰) | Criminal charge |

## Tips for Expat Drivers

3. **Get a dashcam** — Useful for insurance claims and disputes
4. **Download Flitsmeister** — Speed camera warning app (legal in NL)
5. **Use P+R parking** — Park and Ride facilities at city edges (€1-€8/day)
6. **Consider an EV** — Tax advantages make electric cars very attractive
7. **Avoid rush hour** — 7:30-9:00 and 16:30-18:30 on motorways
