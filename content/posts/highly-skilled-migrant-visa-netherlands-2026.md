faq:
  - q: "What is the salary requirement for a highly skilled migrant visa in 2026?"
    a: "For applicants aged 30 and over, the minimum gross monthly salary is €5,331 (excluding 8% holiday allowance). For those under 30, it is €3,909. Reduced rates apply for certain categories like researchers and recent graduates from Dutch universities. These amounts are adjusted annually by the IND."
  - q: "How long does it take to get a highly skilled migrant visa?"
    a: "The standard processing time is 2-4 weeks after the employer submits the application. However, if additional documents are needed or during busy periods, it can take up to 6-8 weeks. Employers with recognized sponsor status benefit from faster processing."
  - q: "Can I change employers on a highly skilled migrant visa?"
    a: "Yes, but your new employer must also be an IND-recognized sponsor and must submit a new visa application for you. There is typically a 3-month grace period between jobs to find a new sponsor. During this time your residence permit remains valid."
  - q: "Does my partner automatically get a visa too?"
    a: "Your partner (spouse or registered partner) can apply for a dependent residence permit, which includes the right to work without restrictions. Unmarried partners must prove they have lived together for at least 6 months or have a notarized cohabitation agreement."
  - q: "Do I need to speak Dutch for a highly skilled migrant visa?"
    a: "No, there is no Dutch language requirement for the highly skilled migrant visa. However, learning Dutch is beneficial for daily life and long-term integration. The inburgeringsexamen (civic integration exam) is not required for highly skilled migrants, unlike some other visa categories."
  - q: "Can I become a permanent resident after a highly skilled migrant visa?"
    a: "Yes, after 5 years of continuous legal residence in the Netherlands, you can apply for permanent residency or Dutch citizenship. Note that for citizenship, you will need to pass the inburgeringsexamen, which includes a Dutch language test at A2 level."

Most of my expat clients come to the Netherlands on a highly skilled migrant visa, and the good news is that it is one of the smoother immigration processes I have seen. Your employer does most of the heavy lifting, and the turnaround is surprisingly fast. That said, I have watched a few applications hit unnecessary snags because of avoidable mistakes. Here is the step-by-step guide I give every client to make sure everything goes right the first time.

| **Salary (30+)** | Minimum €5,331/month gross (excl. holiday allowance) |
| **Salary (under 30)** | Minimum €3,909/month gross (excl. holiday allowance) |

**Note:** EU/EEA and Swiss citizens do not need a work visa for the Netherlands. They have the right to live and work freely.

## The Application Process: Step by Step

### Step 1: Find a Job with a Recognized Sponsor

Your employer must be an IND-recognized sponsor. This means the company has been approved by the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) to hire international workers. Most large companies, universities, and research institutions are recognized sponsors.

You can check the [IND's public register of recognized sponsors](https://ind.nl/en/public-register-recognised-sponsors) to verify your potential employer.

**Important:** If your employer is not yet a recognized sponsor, they can apply for this status, but it takes 4-8 weeks and involves additional requirements.

### Step 2: Employer Submits the Application

Your employer submits the residence permit application to the IND on your behalf. Required documents include:

**From the employer:**
- Completed application form (available on ind.nl)
- Copy of your employment contract showing salary meets the threshold
- Employer declaration (Annex) confirming terms of employment

**From you:**
- Valid passport (valid for at least 6 months beyond planned stay)
- Passport-size photo meeting Dutch requirements
- Proof of qualifications (degree certificates with apostille/legalization)
- Antecedents certificate (criminal background check from your country)
- TB test certificate (if from a designated country — check IND list)

### Step 3: IND Processes the Application

Processing time is typically 2-4 weeks for recognized sponsors. The IND may request additional documents during this period.

If approved, the IND issues a provisional residence permit (MVV) sticker — unless you are from a country exempt from the MVV requirement (US, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and others — check the [IND website](https://ind.nl) for the full list).

### Step 4: Collect Your MVV (if required)

If you need an MVV:
1. Visit the Dutch embassy or consulate in your home country
2. Present your passport and approval letter
3. Receive the MVV sticker in your passport (valid for 90 days)
4. Travel to the Netherlands within this 90-day period

If you are MVV-exempt, you can enter the Netherlands directly and proceed to the next step.

### Step 5: Register and Collect Your Residence Permit

After arriving in the Netherlands:

1. **Register at the municipality (gemeente)** — Within 5 days of arrival. You will receive your BSN (citizen service number), which you need for everything in Dutch life.

2. **Visit the IND desk** — Make an appointment for biometrics (photo and fingerprints) at the IND Expat Center or IND office.

3. **Collect your residence permit card** — Usually ready within 2-4 weeks after biometrics. This card is your proof of legal residence and work authorization.

### Step 6: Set Up Dutch Life

With your BSN and residence permit, you can:
- Open a [Dutch bank account](/posts/best-bank-account-expats-netherlands-2026/)
- Get [Dutch health insurance](/posts/dutch-health-insurance-guide-expats-2026/) (mandatory within 4 months)
- Apply for the [30% ruling](/posts/30-percent-ruling-netherlands-2026/) (tax benefit)
- Register with a huisarts (family doctor)

## The 30% Ruling: Do Not Miss This

If you qualify for the highly skilled migrant visa, you almost certainly qualify for the [30% ruling](/posts/30-percent-ruling-netherlands-2026/). This tax benefit makes 30% of your gross salary tax-free for up to 5 years, significantly increasing your take-home pay.

**Example:** On a €70,000 gross salary, the 30% ruling saves you approximately €8,000-€10,000 per year in taxes.

Your employer must apply for the 30% ruling within 4 months of your start date. Do not delay — late applications are rejected.

## Timeline: From Job Offer to Living in the Netherlands

| Step | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Employer checks sponsor status | 0-8 weeks (if not yet recognized) |
| Gather documents | 1-4 weeks |
| IND application processing | 2-4 weeks |
| MVV collection at embassy | 1-2 weeks |
| Travel to the Netherlands | Within 90 days |
| Municipality registration + BSN | 1 day (with appointment) |
| IND biometrics | 1 week (appointment) |
| Receive residence permit card | 2-4 weeks |
| **Total (best case)** | **6-8 weeks** |
| **Total (typical)** | **8-14 weeks** |

## Family Members

### Partner/Spouse
Your partner can apply for a dependent residence permit simultaneously. They will receive:
- Full right to work in the Netherlands (no restrictions, no separate work permit needed)
- Own residence permit card
- BSN number

**Requirements for partner:**
- Marriage certificate or registered partnership, OR
- Proof of cohabitation for 6+ months, OR
- Notarized cohabitation agreement

### Children
Children under 18 can join you on dependent permits. They can attend school immediately — see my guide to [international schools](/posts/international-schools-netherlands-2026/) or the Dutch education system.

### Parents/Other Family
Parents and other extended family members generally cannot join you under the highly skilled migrant scheme. They would need to apply under the regular family reunification rules, which have stricter income requirements.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Salary drops below threshold** — If your salary drops below the minimum (due to part-time work, leave, or salary reduction), your visa may be revoked. Discuss this with your employer.

2. **Late 30% ruling application** — Must be applied for within 4 months. No exceptions.

3. **Not registering at the municipality** — You must register within 5 days. Delays cause problems with BSN, bank accounts, and health insurance.

4. **Forgetting health insurance** — You must have Dutch basic health insurance within 4 months of arrival. Fines apply for late registration.

5. **Not transferring your driver's license** — Some nationalities can exchange their license. Others must take the Dutch driving exam. Check within 6 months.
