faq:
  - q: "How much does childcare cost in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Before subsidy, daycare costs €8-€10 per hour (€1,200-€2,000/month for 3 days/week). After kinderopvangtoeslag (childcare subsidy), you pay €200-€800/month depending on your income. Lower-income families pay as little as €100-€200/month after subsidy."
  - q: "What childcare subsidy can I get?"
    a: "Kinderopvangtoeslag covers 33-96% of childcare costs, depending on your combined household income. For a family earning €60,000/year, the subsidy covers about 70% of costs. Both parents must work or study to qualify. Apply via toeslagen.nl with your DigiD."
  - q: "What types of childcare exist in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Four main types: kinderdagverblijf (daycare, 0-4 years), gastouderopvang (childminder, 0-12 years), buitenschoolse opvang/BSO (after-school care, 4-12 years), and peuterspeelzaal (playgroup, 2-4 years, 2 mornings/week). All registered types qualify for childcare subsidy."
  - q: "How do I find good childcare in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Search on kinderopvang.nl or kidsnavigator.nl for registered providers. Visit at least 3 options, check GGD inspection reports (landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl), ask about staff ratios, educational approach, and waiting lists. Register early — popular daycare centers have waiting lists of 6-12 months."
  - q: "Do I need to register on a waiting list for daycare?"
    a: "Yes, in most Dutch cities, popular daycare centers have waiting lists of 6-12 months. Register as soon as you know you are pregnant or planning to move. Some areas (Amsterdam, Utrecht, Eindhoven) have particularly long waiting lists."
  - q: "Can I get childcare in English for my children?"
    a: "Some daycare centers offer bilingual (Dutch/English) programs, especially in expat-heavy areas like Amsterdam, The Hague, and Eindhoven. Fully English-only daycare is rare. Most experts recommend Dutch-language childcare to help children integrate and learn the language."

## Costs and Subsidies

### How Kinderopvangtoeslag Works

The Dutch government subsidizes childcare through kinderopvangtoeslag (childcare allowance). The amount depends on:
1. Your combined household income
2. Number of children in childcare
3. Number of hours of childcare

### Subsidy Rates by Income (2026)

| Combined Household Income | 1st Child Subsidy | 2nd+ Child Subsidy |
|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Up to €30,000 | 96% | 96% |
| €40,000 | 90% | 95% |
| €60,000 | 70% | 94% |
| €80,000 | 55% | 93% |
| €100,000 | 43% | 93% |
| €150,000+ | 33% | 86% |

### Cost Examples

**Family income €70,000, 1 child, 3 days/week daycare:**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Gross cost (3 days × €80/day × 52 weeks / 12) | €1,040/month |
| Kinderopvangtoeslag (≈63%) | -€655/month |
| **Net cost to family** | **€385/month** |

**Family income €100,000, 2 children (1 daycare, 1 BSO):**

| Item | Child 1 (daycare, 3 days) | Child 2 (BSO, 3 days) |
|------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Gross cost | €1,040/month | €520/month |
| Subsidy | -€447 (43%) | -€484 (93%) |
| **Net cost** | **€593/month** | **€36/month** |
| **Total family cost** | **€629/month** | |

### How to Apply for Subsidy

1. You need a **DigiD** — See our [DigiD guide](/posts/digid-guide-expats-2026/)
2. Both parents must **work or study** (minimum hours requirement)
3. Childcare provider must be **registered** (check landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl)
4. Apply at [toeslagen.nl](https://www.toeslagen.nl)
5. Subsidy is paid monthly in advance (estimate-based)
6. Annual reconciliation — you may need to pay back or receive extra

**Important:** Be accurate with your income estimate. If you underestimate, you will have to pay back the difference. If you overestimate, you will receive less subsidy than entitled to.

## How to Find Childcare

### Step 1: Start Early
Register on waiting lists as soon as possible. In major cities:
- **Amsterdam:** 6-12 months waiting list
- **The Hague:** 4-8 months
- **Eindhoven:** 3-6 months
- **Smaller cities:** 1-3 months

### Step 2: Search Online
- **kinderopvang.nl** — Search by location and type
- **kidsnavigator.nl** — Reviews and ratings
- **Landelijk Register Kinderopvang** — Check if a provider is registered (required for subsidy)

### Step 3: Visit and Compare
Visit at least 3 providers and observe:
- **Staff interaction** — How do they interact with children?
- **Facilities** — Clean, safe, stimulating environment?
- **Outside space** — Garden or playground?
- **Educational approach** — Montessori, Reggio Emilia, or traditional?
- **Staff ratios** — Meet the minimum legal requirements?
- **Food policy** — Do they provide meals or do you bring your own?
- **Flexibility** — Can you change days? What about sick days?

### Step 4: Check Inspection Reports
The GGD (Health Authority) inspects all registered childcare providers annually. Check inspection reports at [landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl](https://www.landelijkregisterkinderopvang.nl).

## Tips for Expat Parents

1. **Choose Dutch-language childcare** — Children under 6 learn languages remarkably fast. Dutch daycare helps integration and makes primary school much easier
2. **Register on multiple waiting lists** — Do not put all eggs in one basket
3. **Ask about "Wendagen"** — Most daycare centers offer settling-in days where you stay with your child
4. **Know the 11-hour rule** — Childcare hours for subsidy are capped at 140% of your least-working parent's hours
5. **Check school holidays** — BSO offers full-day care during school holidays, included in your contract
6. **Tax deduction** — The net childcare costs (after subsidy) are NOT additionally tax-deductible
