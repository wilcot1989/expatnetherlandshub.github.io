Rotterdam is the Netherlands' second-largest city and its most dynamic. While Amsterdam draws tourists with its canals and historic charm, Rotterdam attracts people with its modern architecture, entrepreneurial spirit, and gritty energy. The city was almost entirely rebuilt after World War II, resulting in a skyline of bold, contemporary architecture that is unique in the Netherlands.

For expats, Rotterdam offers something increasingly rare in the Randstad: a major, international city where housing is still relatively affordable and the quality of life is excellent. This guide covers everything you need to know about moving to Rotterdam in 2026.
