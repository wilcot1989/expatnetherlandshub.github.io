faq:
  - q: "Is health insurance mandatory for expats in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes, if you live and work in the Netherlands, you are legally required to have Dutch basic health insurance (basisverzekering) within 4 months of arriving. This applies to employees, self-employed workers, and their dependents. Students from EU countries may be exempt if they have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)."
  - q: "How much does health insurance cost for expats in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Basic health insurance (basisverzekering) costs €120-€145 per month in 2026. On top of that, you pay a mandatory deductible (eigen risico) of €385 per year. Supplementary insurance costs €10-€80 per month extra. Low-income earners may qualify for healthcare allowance (zorgtoeslag) of up to €175/month."
  - q: "Can I keep my international health insurance instead of Dutch insurance?"
    a: "Generally no. If you work in the Netherlands (employed or self-employed), you must take out Dutch basic health insurance. Exceptions include posted workers (detachering) from EU countries and some international organization employees. Students with an EHIC may also be exempt."
  - q: "What does Dutch basic health insurance cover?"
    a: "Basisverzekering covers GP visits, hospital care, prescription medication, mental health care, maternity care, dental care for children under 18, and ambulance transport. It does NOT cover dental care for adults, physiotherapy (first sessions), glasses/contact lenses, or alternative medicine. You need supplementary insurance for these."
  - q: "Do I need liability insurance (aansprakelijkheidsverzekering) in the Netherlands?"
    a: "While not legally required, liability insurance is considered essential in the Netherlands. It covers damage you accidentally cause to others or their property. Premiums start at just €3-€5 per month and cover damages up to €1.25-€2.5 million. Most Dutch residents have this insurance."
  - q: "What insurance do I need as a freelancer/ZZP in the Netherlands?"
    a: "As a ZZP (freelancer), you need: basic health insurance (mandatory), liability insurance (strongly recommended), professional liability insurance (beroepsaansprakelijkheidsverzekering), and disability insurance (arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering). Disability insurance is the most expensive but crucial since ZZPers have no employer safety net."

I learned about Dutch liability insurance the hard way -- my bicycle knocked over a parked scooter in my first month, and suddenly I owed someone several hundred euros. Turns out, nearly every Dutch person has a three-euro-per-month policy that would have covered it. That was just one of many insurance surprises in a system that works brilliantly once you understand it. Here is the full breakdown of every insurance you need as an expat, from the mandatory to the "technically optional but you really should."

## 1. Health Insurance (Zorgverzekering) — Mandatory

### How the Dutch System Works

The Netherlands has a unique healthcare system combining public regulation with private insurance. Every resident must have basic health insurance (basisverzekering), which is provided by private insurance companies but regulated by the government.

**The three layers:**
1. **Basisverzekering** (basic insurance) — Mandatory, same coverage at every insurer, costs €120-€145/month
2. **Aanvullende verzekering** (supplementary) — Optional, covers extras like dental, physiotherapy
3. **Eigen risico** (deductible) — Mandatory €385/year out-of-pocket before insurer pays (GP visits exempt)

### What Basic Insurance Covers

| Covered ✅ | NOT Covered ❌ |
|-----------|---------------|
| GP (huisarts) visits | Adult dental care |
| Hospital care | Glasses/contact lenses |
| Specialist consultations | Physiotherapy (first sessions) |
| Prescription medication | Alternative medicine |
| Mental health care | Cosmetic procedures |
| Maternity care | Most vaccinations |
| Ambulance transport | Non-essential medication |
| Medical devices | — |

### Best Health Insurance Providers for Expats

| Provider | Monthly Premium | Expat-Friendly | English Support |
|----------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **CZ** | €130-€140 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ✅ Online |
| **Zilveren Kruis** | €125-€140 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ✅ Phone + online |
| **VGZ** | €128-€138 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Partial |
| **Menzis** | €125-€135 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Partial |
| **ONVZ** | €135-€145 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ✅ Full |

**Our recommendation:** ONVZ or Zilveren Kruis for expats. Both have excellent English-language support, online portals in English, and experience serving international clients.

### Healthcare Allowance (Zorgtoeslag)

If your income is below a certain threshold, you may qualify for healthcare allowance (zorgtoeslag) from the government. In 2026:
- **Single person:** Income up to ~€38,000 → up to €175/month
- **Couple:** Combined income up to ~€48,000 → up to €175/month per person

Apply via [toeslagen.nl](https://www.toeslagen.nl) — you need a DigiD. See our [DigiD guide for expats](/posts/digid-guide-expats-2026/).

### Supplementary Insurance: Do You Need It?

Consider supplementary insurance if you need:
- **Dental care** — Basic cleanings + checkups cost €200-€400/year uninsured
- **Physiotherapy** — First 12-20 sessions are often not covered by basic insurance
- **Glasses/contacts** — Supplementary may cover €100-€200 per 2 years
- **Alternative medicine** — Acupuncture, osteopathy, etc.

**Tip:** You can switch health insurance every year during the open enrollment period (November 12 - December 31) for the following year.

## 2. Liability Insurance (Aansprakelijkheidsverzekering) — Essential

Liability insurance is not mandatory but is considered essential by virtually all Dutch residents. It covers damage you accidentally cause to other people or their property.

### What It Covers
- Accidentally damaging someone's property (e.g., spilling wine on an expensive laptop)
- Your child breaking a neighbor's window
- Your pet causing injury or damage
- Water damage to downstairs neighbors from your apartment
- Bicycle collisions causing injury to others

### Cost and Coverage

| Coverage Level | Monthly Cost | Maximum Coverage |
|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Basic | €3-€5 | €1,250,000 |
| Extended | €5-€8 | €2,500,000 |
| Premium | €8-€12 | €5,000,000 |

**Our recommendation:** Even the basic level is sufficient for most expats. At €3-€5/month, this is one of the cheapest and most valuable insurances you can have.

## 3. Home Contents Insurance (Inboedelverzekering) — Recommended

Home contents insurance covers your belongings inside your home against damage from fire, theft, water damage, and storm.

### What It Covers
- Furniture and electronics
- Clothing and personal items
- Kitchen appliances
- Bicycles (often with supplement)
- Damage from fire, theft, storm, water leaks

### Cost
- **Apartment:** €8-€15/month
- **House:** €15-€25/month
- **Premium depends on:** Location, value of contents, building type

**Tip for renters:** Your landlord's insurance does NOT cover your personal belongings. If your apartment floods or catches fire, you need your own inboedelverzekering to replace your things.

## 4. Travel Insurance (Reisverzekering)

As an expat, you likely travel more than average — visiting home, exploring Europe, or business trips. A travel insurance covers medical emergencies, luggage loss, and trip cancellations.

### Options

| Type | Coverage | Cost/Year | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Doorlopende reisverzekering** | Continuous, all trips | €60-€150 | Frequent travelers |
| **Kortlopende reisverzekering** | Single trip | €15-€40 | Occasional travel |

**World coverage including USA:** Add €20-€50/year for worldwide coverage. Essential if you visit the US or Canada where medical costs are extremely high.

For international travel insurance that works globally, <a href="https://safetywing.com/?referenceID=digitalshieldpro" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">SafetyWing Nomad Insurance</a> offers flexible monthly coverage starting at $45/month — ideal for expats who travel frequently or work remotely.

## 5. Disability Insurance (Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekering) — For Self-Employed

If you are self-employed (ZZP) in the Netherlands, disability insurance is critical. Unlike employees who are covered by their employer, ZZPers have no safety net if they cannot work due to illness or injury.

### Why It Matters
- **No employer backup** — If you cannot work, you have zero income
- **Social safety net is minimal** — You may qualify for bijstand (welfare) after depleting savings
- **Potentially mandatory from 2027** — The government is considering making this mandatory for all ZZP workers

### Cost
- **Monthly premium:** €50-€200 (depends on income, age, occupation, waiting period)
- **Coverage:** 70-80% of your income
- **Waiting period:** 30 days (expensive) to 365 days (cheaper)

**Tip:** Choose a longer waiting period (90-180 days) to reduce premiums, and keep 3-6 months of savings as a buffer.

## 6. Legal Expenses Insurance (Rechtsbijstandverzekering) — Optional

Legal expenses insurance covers the cost of legal assistance in disputes. In the Netherlands, where legal matters can be complex (especially for expats), this can be valuable.

### Common Situations Where It Helps
- Disputes with your landlord
- Employment conflicts
- Consumer complaints
- Traffic accidents
- Neighbor disputes

### Cost
- **Monthly premium:** €15-€25
- **Coverage:** Legal advice, mediation, and court costs

**Consider it if:** You rent (landlord disputes are common), have a Dutch employment contract, or want peace of mind navigating Dutch legal systems.

## Insurance Comparison by Expat Situation

| Your Situation | Must Have | Should Have | Consider |
|---------------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Employee, single** | Health | Liability, home contents | Travel, legal |
| **Employee, family** | Health (all members) | Liability, home contents | Travel, life, legal |
| **Freelancer (ZZP)** | Health | Liability, disability, professional liability | Home contents, legal |
| **Student** | Health (or EHIC) | Liability | Travel |
| **Recently arrived** | Health (within 4 months) | Liability | Home contents |

## How to Save on Insurance

1. **Compare annually** — Use comparison sites like Independer or Pricewise during the switching period (November-December)
2. **Bundle policies** — Many insurers offer 5-10% discount when you combine multiple insurances
3. **Higher deductible** — Opting for a higher eigen risico (up to €885) lowers your monthly premium by €15-€25
4. **Healthcare allowance** — Check if you qualify for zorgtoeslag to offset health insurance costs
5. **Employer benefits** — Some employers offer group insurance rates or contribute to your health insurance

## Common Mistakes Expats Make

1. **Waiting too long for health insurance** — You must register within 4 months or face fines
2. **Keeping international insurance** — This usually does not meet the Dutch legal requirement
3. **Skipping liability insurance** — At €3-€5/month, the risk-reward is a no-brainer
4. **Not claiming zorgtoeslag** — Many expats qualify but do not apply
5. **Ignoring disability insurance as ZZP** — The biggest financial risk for freelancers
6. **Over-insuring** — You do not need every supplementary insurance available
