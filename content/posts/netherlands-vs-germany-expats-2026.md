faq:
  - q: "Is it better to live in the Netherlands or Germany as an expat?"
    a: "It depends on your priorities. The Netherlands offers higher English proficiency, the 30% tax ruling for skilled migrants, and a more international work culture. Germany offers lower housing costs (outside Munich and Frankfurt), higher salaries in engineering and manufacturing, and more job opportunities due to its larger economy."
  - q: "Are salaries higher in the Netherlands or Germany?"
    a: "Base salaries are generally comparable, but the Netherlands has a significant tax advantage through the 30% ruling, which makes 30% of your salary tax-free for up to 5 years. This effectively increases take-home pay by 10-20% compared to a similar gross salary in Germany."
  - q: "Is housing cheaper in Germany than the Netherlands?"
    a: "Generally yes. Average rent in German cities (excluding Munich) is 20-40% lower than comparable Dutch cities. A 2-bedroom apartment in Berlin costs around EUR 1,200/month versus EUR 1,800 in Amsterdam. However, the Dutch rental market is more regulated with stronger tenant protections."
  - q: "Do I need to learn Dutch or German to work?"
    a: "In the Netherlands, many companies operate entirely in English, especially in tech, finance, and international business. In Germany, German language skills are more frequently required, even in international companies. However, both countries expect long-term residents to learn the local language for daily life and integration."
  - q: "Which country has better healthcare?"
    a: "Both countries have excellent healthcare systems but structured differently. The Netherlands uses mandatory private insurance (starting at ~EUR 130/month) with a personal deductible of EUR 385/year. Germany uses a dual public-private system where employees earning under EUR 69,300/year must use public insurance (14.6% of salary, split with employer)."
  - q: "Which country is easier to get a work visa for?"
    a: "Both countries offer skilled worker visas, but the Dutch kennismigrant visa is generally faster to process (2-4 weeks vs 1-3 months for the German Blue Card). The Netherlands also has a more streamlined process with IND-recognized sponsors handling most paperwork."

## Salary and Taxes: The 30% Ruling Changes Everything

### Gross Salaries

Gross salaries for skilled professionals are broadly comparable between the two countries. A software engineer in Amsterdam earns roughly EUR 55,000-80,000, while the same role in Munich or Berlin pays EUR 55,000-85,000. Senior roles in Germany's automotive and engineering sectors can command higher salaries due to the sheer size of companies like Volkswagen, Siemens, and BMW.

However, comparing gross salaries alone is misleading. What matters is what ends up in your bank account.

### The Dutch 30% Ruling Advantage

The Netherlands offers the 30% ruling, one of the most generous expat tax benefits in Europe. If you qualify as a highly skilled migrant recruited from abroad, your employer can pay 30% of your gross salary as a tax-free allowance for up to 5 years.

Here is what that looks like in practice:

| Scenario | Netherlands (with 30% ruling) | Germany |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Gross salary | EUR 70,000 | EUR 70,000 |
| Taxable income | EUR 49,000 (70%) | EUR 70,000 |
| Approximate income tax | EUR 15,800 | EUR 22,500 |
| Social contributions | ~EUR 5,200 | ~EUR 9,800 |
| **Approximate net income** | **~EUR 49,000** | **~EUR 37,700** |

On the same gross salary, the 30% ruling gives you roughly EUR 11,000 more per year in take-home pay. Over the 5-year duration of the ruling, that amounts to over EUR 55,000 in additional income. Read our [complete guide to the 30% ruling](/posts/30-percent-ruling-netherlands-2026/) for full details on eligibility and how to apply.

### Germany's Tax Structure

Germany has no equivalent to the 30% ruling. The tax system is progressive with rates from 14% to 45%, plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge on the tax amount. Church tax (8-9% of income tax) applies if you are registered with a recognized church, which catches some expats by surprise. Social contributions in Germany are also higher, covering pension, unemployment insurance, healthcare, and long-term care insurance.

## Cost of Living

Day-to-day costs are somewhat similar, but housing creates the biggest gap.

| Category | Netherlands | Germany |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Meal at a mid-range restaurant (2 people) | EUR 70-100 | EUR 50-80 |
| Monthly groceries (single) | EUR 250-350 | EUR 200-300 |
| Monthly public transport pass | EUR 100-150 | EUR 49 (Deutschlandticket) |
| Utilities (monthly, apartment) | EUR 150-250 | EUR 200-300 |
| Beer at a bar (0.5L) | EUR 5-7 | EUR 4-5 |
| Internet (monthly) | EUR 35-55 | EUR 30-45 |

Germany has a notable advantage in public transport with the Deutschlandticket, a nationwide monthly pass for EUR 49 that covers all local and regional trains, trams, and buses. The Netherlands has no equivalent; a single train trip from Amsterdam to Rotterdam costs around EUR 17.

Groceries are slightly cheaper in Germany, and dining out is noticeably less expensive, especially outside major cities. However, the Netherlands compensates with higher net salaries for qualifying expats and generally shorter commutes.

## Housing: Germany Wins on Price

Housing is where Germany has its clearest advantage, at least outside Munich.

| City | 2-Bedroom Apartment (Center) |
|------|------------------------------|
| Amsterdam | EUR 1,800-3,000 |
| Rotterdam | EUR 1,400-2,200 |
| The Hague | EUR 1,300-2,000 |
| Berlin | EUR 1,100-1,800 |
| Hamburg | EUR 1,200-1,900 |
| Munich | EUR 1,800-2,800 |
| Frankfurt | EUR 1,300-2,100 |
| Düsseldorf | EUR 1,100-1,700 |

Berlin remains one of the best-value major cities in Western Europe for rental housing, though prices have risen sharply over the past five years. Munich is the exception to Germany's affordability advantage, with rents approaching Amsterdam levels.

Both countries face housing shortages, but the Dutch market is generally considered tighter. In the Netherlands, it is common to encounter bidding on rental properties, especially in Amsterdam and Utrecht. German cities have more rental supply, and tenant protection laws (Mietpreisbremse) cap rent increases in designated areas.

One practical difference: many Dutch rentals are offered unfurnished (kaal), meaning no flooring, light fixtures, or curtains. German rentals can also be bare, but furnished and semi-furnished options are more commonly available, particularly in cities with large expat populations.

## Healthcare: Two Excellent Systems, Very Different Structures

### The Netherlands

The Dutch healthcare system is based on mandatory private insurance. Every resident must purchase a basic health insurance policy (basisverzekering) from a private insurer. Key facts for 2026:

- Basic premium: approximately EUR 140-175 per month
- Mandatory annual deductible (eigen risico): EUR 385
- Children under 18: covered free under a parent's policy
- GP (huisarts) visits: covered under basic insurance, no deductible
- Low-income residents may qualify for zorgtoeslag (healthcare allowance) up to EUR 150/month

The Dutch system emphasizes the GP as a gatekeeper. You cannot see a specialist without a GP referral, which can feel frustrating if you are used to direct access.

### Germany

Germany uses a dual public-private system. If your gross salary is below EUR 69,300 per year (2026 threshold), you must be enrolled in statutory public health insurance (gesetzliche Krankenversicherung). Above that threshold, you can opt for private insurance.

- Public insurance: approximately 14.6% of gross salary, split equally between employee and employer, plus a supplementary contribution of 1-2%
- Private insurance: premiums based on age, health, and coverage level, typically EUR 300-700/month
- No mandatory deductible in the public system
- Direct access to specialists without GP referral

German healthcare offers more freedom of choice, including direct access to specialists and a wider range of private options. The Dutch system is simpler and generally cheaper for younger expats, but the gatekeeper model requires patience.

## Language and Integration

This is one of the starkest differences between the two countries.

### English in the Netherlands

The Netherlands ranks consistently as one of the top countries in the world for English proficiency. In Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Eindhoven, you can live, work, and socialize almost entirely in English. Many Dutch companies use English as their working language, especially in tech, finance, and multinational environments.

The downside: because everyone speaks English so well, learning Dutch can be surprisingly difficult. People switch to English the moment they detect an accent, which limits your practice opportunities. Long-term, speaking Dutch matters for deeper integration, career advancement in Dutch organizations, and government interactions.

### German in Germany

Germany is less uniformly English-friendly. In Berlin's tech scene or at international companies in Frankfurt and Munich, English may be sufficient for work. But in many German workplaces, meetings, emails, and documentation are conducted in German. Outside major cities, daily life without German can be genuinely challenging.

The expectation to learn German is stronger and more immediate. Job postings frequently list "German C1" as a requirement, even at international companies. On the positive side, German language courses are widely available, often subsidized by the government through integration programs, and your colleagues are less likely to switch away from German, giving you more immersion practice.

## Work Culture

### Dutch Work Culture

Dutch work culture is characterized by directness, flat hierarchies, and a strong emphasis on work-life balance. Key traits:

- **Direct communication**: The Dutch say what they mean. Feedback is blunt and constructive, which can feel uncomfortable at first but creates clarity
- **Flat hierarchy**: Junior employees are expected to speak up in meetings. Titles matter less than contributions
- **Part-time culture**: The Netherlands has the highest rate of part-time work in Europe. Working 4 days per week is common and widely accepted, even in senior roles
- **Meeting culture**: Decisions are made by consensus (overleg), which means many meetings but thorough buy-in
- **Work-life balance**: Leaving the office at 17:00 is normal and expected. Working evenings or weekends is unusual

### German Work Culture

German work culture is more structured and hierarchical, with a strong emphasis on precision and punctuality:

- **Formal communication**: Professional interactions tend to be more formal, especially initially. Using titles (Herr Doktor, Frau Professor) is still common in some industries
- **Clear hierarchy**: Roles and responsibilities are well-defined. Decisions often flow top-down
- **Punctuality is sacred**: Being late, even by five minutes, is considered disrespectful
- **Thoroughness over speed**: German business culture values careful planning and detailed documentation. Projects may move slower but tend to be well-executed
- **Work-life separation**: Germans take their free time seriously. Contacting colleagues outside work hours is frowned upon, and vacation time (typically 25-30 days) is genuinely respected

## Visa and Immigration

### Dutch Kennismigrant Visa

The Netherlands' highly skilled migrant visa (kennismigrant) is known for its speed and simplicity:

- Processing time: 2-4 weeks (employer must be an IND-recognized sponsor)
- Minimum salary: approximately EUR 5,008/month gross (age 30+) or EUR 3,672 (under 30) in 2026
- Your employer handles most paperwork
- Spouse/partner receives an open work permit
- Path to permanent residency after 5 years

### German EU Blue Card

Germany's EU Blue Card is the primary route for skilled non-EU workers:

- Processing time: 1-3 months (varies by region and embassy)
- Minimum salary: approximately EUR 45,300/year (regular professions) or EUR 41,000 (shortage occupations) in 2026
- More extensive documentation required
- Spouse receives a work permit
- Path to permanent residency after 21-33 months (depending on German language level)

The Dutch system is generally faster and more streamlined, partly because recognized sponsors can submit applications directly to the IND. The German process involves more bureaucratic steps and varies significantly between federal states (Bundesländer).

## Daily Life: Cycling vs Driving

One of the most visible differences between the two countries is how people get around.

The Netherlands is famously a cycling nation. Over 27% of all trips are made by bicycle, and cities are designed around cycling infrastructure. Dedicated bike lanes, bike traffic lights, and massive parking garages for bicycles are standard. For many expats, the daily commute on a bicycle becomes one of the most enjoyable aspects of Dutch life.

Germany is more car-oriented. While cities like Berlin and Munich have good public transport and growing cycling infrastructure, most Germans rely on cars for daily commuting, especially outside urban centers. The Autobahn offers stretches with no speed limit, and car culture is deeply embedded. That said, the Deutschlandticket has made public transport significantly more accessible and affordable.

Both countries have excellent rail networks. Dutch trains (NS) are frequent and cover a compact country efficiently. German trains (Deutsche Bahn) cover a much larger network but have a reputation for delays and cancellations that has become something of a national joke.

### Social Life

Building a social circle is a common challenge in both countries. The Dutch are famously friendly but notoriously difficult to befriend deeply. Social circles are often established in childhood and can feel closed to newcomers. Expat communities, sports clubs, and borrels (informal drinks events) are the main entry points.

Germany shares a similar pattern, though the culture is generally considered slightly more open to forming new friendships in adulthood, particularly in diverse cities like Berlin. Verein culture (clubs and associations for everything from hiking to board games) provides a structured way to meet people.

For privacy and security while settling into a new country, using a VPN on public Wi-Fi networks in cafes, coworking spaces, and shared housing is advisable. <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> works reliably in both countries and lets you access content from your home country while abroad.

## The Verdict: Who Should Choose Which?

There is no universally better choice. The right country depends on your profession, priorities, and personality.

### Choose the Netherlands if:

- You work in tech, finance, startups, or international business
- You value the 30% tax ruling and want to maximize take-home pay in your first 5 years
- English is your primary (or only) working language
- You prefer cycling over driving
- You appreciate direct communication and flat hierarchies
- You want a faster, simpler visa process
- Work-life balance and part-time options are important to you

### Choose Germany if:

- You work in engineering, manufacturing, automotive, or research
- You already speak some German or are committed to learning it
- Lower housing costs are a priority
- You prefer a larger country with more diverse cities and regions
- You want access to the Deutschlandticket for cheap nationwide transport
- You value a more structured, formal work environment
- A faster path to permanent residency appeals to you (21 months vs 5 years)

### Or Consider Both

Some expats move to the Netherlands first to take advantage of the 30% ruling, build savings, and establish a European career, then relocate to Germany when the ruling expires and housing costs become a greater concern. Others do the reverse, starting in Germany to learn the language and later moving to the Netherlands for a more international environment. Both pathways are viable, and the proximity of the two countries makes the transition straightforward.

Whatever you decide, take the time to visit both countries, speak to expats already living there, and evaluate your specific career opportunities before committing. The right choice is the one that aligns with where you are in your life and career right now.
