faq:
  - q: "How much does coworking cost in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Prices vary by city and plan: hot desk (flexible seating) costs €150-€350/month, dedicated desk €250-€500/month, and a private office €400-€1,500/month. Day passes cost €15-€35. Amsterdam is the most expensive, while cities like Eindhoven and Utrecht are 20-30% cheaper."
  - q: "Which coworking space is best for expats?"
    a: "WeWork and Spaces (by Regus) are best for international expats — English is the default language, the community is diverse, and locations are in multiple cities. For a more local/startup atmosphere, try B.Amsterdam, The Hague Tech, or High Tech Campus Eindhoven."
  - q: "Can I use a coworking address for my business registration?"
    a: "Yes, most coworking spaces offer a virtual office or business address service (€50-€150/month) that you can use for your KvK (Chamber of Commerce) registration. This is common for freelancers (ZZP'ers) who work from home but want a professional business address."
  - q: "Do coworking spaces offer meeting rooms?"
    a: "Yes, nearly all coworking spaces have meeting rooms available for members (free or discounted) and non-members (€20-€75/hour). Most include a screen, whiteboard, and video conferencing equipment. Book in advance for popular time slots."
  - q: "Is coworking tax-deductible in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes, coworking costs are fully tax-deductible as a business expense for ZZP'ers and freelancers. Keep your invoices and include the costs in your annual tax return under 'kantoorkosten' (office costs). If you have a BV, the company can directly deduct the expense."
  - q: "What should I look for in a coworking space?"
    a: "Key factors: location (near public transport), internet speed (minimum 100 Mbps), community and networking events, meeting room availability, flexible contracts (monthly cancellable), kitchen/coffee facilities, printing, and whether the atmosphere matches your work style (quiet vs social)."

## Tips for Choosing a Coworking Space

### 1. Try Before You Commit
Most spaces offer a free trial day or week. Use it. The vibe, noise level, and community matter more than the photos suggest.

### 2. Check the Contract Terms
- **Monthly cancellable** is standard — avoid long lock-in periods
- Watch for hidden costs: printing, meeting rooms, parking, coffee
- Some spaces charge extra for after-hours access

### 3. Consider Your Commute
A coworking space near your home saves you commute time and money. Check OV (public transport) connections — most premium spaces are near train stations.

### 4. Think About Community
The best coworking spaces aren't just desks — they're communities. Look for:
- Regular networking events and workshops
- A community manager who introduces members
- A mix of industries (not just one type of business)
- English-speaking environment if your Dutch is limited

### 5. Internet Speed Matters
For remote workers on video calls, internet speed is crucial. Ask about:
- Download/upload speed (minimum 100/50 Mbps)
- Dedicated business line vs shared residential
- Backup connection

## Tax Deductions for Coworking
