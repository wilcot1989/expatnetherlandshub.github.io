faq:
  - q: "Who is exempt from the inburgeringsexamen?"
    a: "EU/EEA and Swiss citizens are exempt. Other exemptions include those who completed Dutch-language education (such as a Dutch high school diploma or university degree), people under 16 or over the state pension age, those who hold a residence permit as a highly skilled migrant (kennismigrant) or European Blue Card holder, and people who can prove they are unable to take the exam due to a physical or mental disability. The IND and DUO can advise on your specific situation."
  - q: "How much does the inburgeringsexamen cost?"
    a: "Under the new Civic Integration Act (Wi2021), the municipality arranges and pays for your integration program if you fall under the new system. If you fall under the old system (arrived before January 1, 2022), exam fees are approximately EUR 150 per exam component, and you are responsible for your own study costs. Additional costs may include study materials (EUR 200-500), language courses (EUR 1,000-5,000 depending on provider), and practice exams."
  - q: "How long do I have to pass the inburgeringsexamen?"
    a: "Under the new system (Wi2021), you have 3 years to complete your integration program, though extensions may be granted in certain circumstances. Under the old system, the deadline was also 3 years but extensions were more commonly granted. Missing your deadline can result in fines of up to EUR 1,340 and may affect your residence permit renewal or eligibility for permanent residency."
  - q: "What language level do I need to pass the inburgeringsexamen?"
    a: "Under the Wi2021 system, the target level is B1 on the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for reading, listening, writing, and speaking. The old system required A2 level. Your municipality will assess your potential level at the start and create a personalized learning route (leerroute). Some people may be assigned a lower target if B1 is not achievable within the timeframe."
  - q: "Can I take the inburgeringsexamen in English?"
    a: "No. The language exams (reading, writing, listening, speaking) are entirely in Dutch, as the purpose is to demonstrate Dutch language proficiency. The KNM (Knowledge of Dutch Society) exam is also in Dutch. However, study materials for KNM are available in many languages, so you can learn the content in your native language before tackling it in Dutch."
  - q: "What happens if I fail the inburgeringsexamen?"
    a: "You can retake any component that you fail. Under the old system, you pay the exam fee again for each retake. Under the new system, your municipality manages retakes as part of your learning route. There is no limit on the number of retakes, but you must pass all components before your deadline expires. Many people pass some components on the first attempt and need one or two retakes for the more difficult parts."
  - q: "Is the inburgeringsexamen the same as the NT2 exam?"
    a: "No. The inburgeringsexamen tests Dutch at A2-B1 level as part of civic integration requirements. The NT2 (Nederlands als Tweede Taal) is a separate, higher-level exam at B1-B2 level, recognized by Dutch educational institutions and employers. Passing NT2 State Exam II can exempt you from the language components of the inburgeringsexamen. If you plan to study at a Dutch university or need formal proof of Dutch proficiency for employment, NT2 is the more widely recognized qualification."

As a half-Dutch, half-British person, I am technically exempt from the inburgeringsexamen. But I have coached so many clients through it that I practically know the KNM exam by heart. The biggest thing I have learned: it is not as scary as people think, but the preparation matters enormously. I have seen well-educated professionals fail because they underestimated it, and I have seen others with less formal education pass on the first try because they prepared strategically. Here is how to approach it.

## What Is the Inburgeringsexamen?

The inburgeringsexamen, or civic integration exam, is a set of tests that demonstrates you have learned enough Dutch and know enough about Dutch society to participate in everyday life. It is a legal requirement for most non-EU immigrants who want to settle in the Netherlands permanently.

The exam is governed by the **Wet inburgering 2021 (Wi2021)**, the Civic Integration Act that came into effect on January 1, 2022. This law significantly changed the integration system, making municipalities responsible for guiding newcomers through their integration process.

### Old System vs. New System (Wi2021)

| Feature | Old System (before Jan 2022) | New System (Wi2021) |
|---------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Applies to** | Arrivals before Jan 1, 2022 | Arrivals from Jan 1, 2022 |
| **Who organizes** | You arrange everything yourself | Municipality arranges your program |
| **Language target** | A2 | B1 (with exceptions) |
| **Exam components** | Reading, Listening, Writing, Speaking, KNM, ONA | Integrated into learning route |
| **Cost** | You pay (loan available via DUO) | Municipality pays for the program |
| **Learning route** | Self-directed | Personalized route assigned by municipality |
| **Deadline** | 3 years (extensions possible) | 3 years (extensions possible) |

If you arrived after January 1, 2022, your municipality will invite you for a broad intake assessment within your first weeks. This assessment determines your learning route and the level you are expected to achieve.

**What to expect:**
- Duration: approximately 45 minutes

**What it involves:**
- Understanding the Dutch job market
- Creating a CV in Dutch format
- Practicing job interviews

## How to Prepare: A Step-by-Step Study Plan

### Months 1-3: Build Your Foundation

1. **Start learning Dutch immediately** when you arrive (or even before you move). Use a structured app like [Babbel](https://www.babbel.com/) to build vocabulary and grammar from day one. Babbel's Dutch course is designed by linguists and focuses on practical conversation skills, making it ideal for building the foundation you need for the exam.

2. **Register with your municipality** and attend the broad intake assessment. This determines your learning route.

3. **Immerse yourself in Dutch**: Change your phone language to Dutch, watch Dutch TV, listen to Dutch radio. Even if you understand almost nothing at first, immersion builds familiarity with the sounds and rhythm of the language.

4. **Get the KNM study materials** in your native language and start learning about Dutch society.

### Months 3-6: Structured Learning

1. **Follow your municipality's learning route**. Under Wi2021, your municipality connects you with a language school and monitors your progress.

2. **Supplement with self-study**. Use [Pimsleur](https://www.pimsleur.com/) for speaking and listening practice. Pimsleur's audio-based method is particularly effective for the speaking and listening components of the exam, as it trains you to produce and understand Dutch in real-time conversations.

3. **Start taking DUO practice exams**. The official practice exams are the closest thing to the real exam and are available for free on the DUO website. Take one early to identify your weak areas.

4. **Join a language exchange**. Apps like Tandem or HelloTalk connect you with Dutch speakers who want to learn your language. Regular conversation practice is irreplaceable.

5. **Read the KNM material thoroughly**. Start in your native language, then switch to the Dutch version as your language improves.

### Months 6-12: Exam Preparation

1. **Take all available practice exams** for each component. Time yourself and simulate exam conditions.

2. **Focus on your weakest component**. Most people find speaking or writing the hardest. Dedicate extra time to the area where you score lowest on practice exams.

3. **Join an exam preparation course** if your municipality offers one, or ask your language school about intensive exam prep.

4. **Practice KNM questions repeatedly**. The question format is predictable, and many questions are recycled. Knowing the format reduces anxiety on exam day.

5. **Schedule your exams strategically**. You do not have to take all components on the same day. Many people take KNM first (as it requires less language skill than the other components) and save speaking and writing for later.

## Costs and Financial Support

### Under the New System (Wi2021)

If you arrived after January 1, 2022, your municipality arranges and finances your integration program. This includes language courses, exam fees, and guidance. You do not need to take a loan from DUO.

However, if you do not complete your integration within the deadline or put in insufficient effort, you may be required to repay costs.

### Under the Old System

If you arrived before January 1, 2022, you are responsible for arranging and paying for your own integration. Costs include:

- **Exam fees**: ~EUR 150 per component (6 components = ~EUR 900 for all exams)
- **Retake fees**: Same per-component fee for each retake
- **Language courses**: EUR 1,000-5,000 depending on intensity and provider
- **Study materials**: EUR 200-500
- **Total estimated cost**: EUR 2,000-6,000+

DUO offers loans of up to EUR 10,000 for integration costs. If you pass all exams within the deadline, the loan is forgiven. If you do not pass, you must repay the loan.

## The Three Learning Routes (Wi2021)

Under the new system, your municipality assigns you one of three learning routes based on your intake assessment.

### B1 Route

The standard route for most newcomers. The goal is to achieve B1 level in Dutch and pass all integration requirements. This route combines language classes with practical activities like volunteering or an internship.

### Education Route (Onderwijsroute)

For newcomers with the potential and ambition to enter Dutch higher education. This route aims for a higher language level and prepares you for entry into MBO, HBO, or university programs.

### Z-Route (Zelfredzaamheidsroute)

For newcomers who are unlikely to reach B1 level within the deadline, often due to limited educational background or learning difficulties. The focus is on becoming self-sufficient in daily Dutch life rather than achieving a formal language level.

## Tips for Exam Day

1. **Bring valid ID** (passport or residence card). Without it, you cannot take the exam.
2. **Arrive early**. Exam locations can be confusing, and stress affects performance.
3. **The speaking exam is computer-based**. Speak clearly and at a normal pace. You do not need perfect grammar; fluency and comprehensibility matter more.
4. **For reading and listening**, read all answer options before choosing. Elimination works well for multiple-choice questions.
5. **For KNM**, trust your preparation. Most questions test practical knowledge, not obscure details.
6. **Stay calm during listening exercises**. If you miss something, move on. You cannot replay audio, and dwelling on one question costs you time for the next.

## After Passing: What Comes Next

Once you pass all components of the inburgeringsexamen, several doors open:

- **Permanent residence permit**: After 5 years of legal residence in the Netherlands, you can apply for an indefinite residence permit. Passing the inburgeringsexamen is a requirement.
- **Dutch citizenship**: After 5 years of residence (or 3 years if married to a Dutch citizen), you can apply for naturalization. The inburgering diploma is a prerequisite.
- **Better job opportunities**: B1-level Dutch significantly expands your employment options beyond international companies.
- **Deeper integration**: Understanding Dutch allows you to participate more fully in your community, understand your children's school communications, and navigate bureaucracy independently.

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Waiting too long to start studying**. Three years sounds like a long time, but reaching B1 from zero requires consistent effort. Start immediately.
2. **Relying only on English**. The Dutch are famously good at English, but this can slow your Dutch learning. Ask people to speak Dutch with you.
3. **Ignoring KNM**. Many people focus only on language and underestimate KNM. It requires specific study.
4. **Not using practice exams**. The DUO practice exams closely mirror the real exam. Familiarity with the format is half the battle.
5. **Studying in isolation**. Language learning is faster and more sustainable when combined with real-world use. Volunteer, join clubs, talk to neighbors.
