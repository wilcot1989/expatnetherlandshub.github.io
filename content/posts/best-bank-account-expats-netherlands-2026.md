faq:
  - q: "Can I open a Dutch bank account without a BSN?"
    a: "Traditional Dutch banks (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank) require a BSN to open an account. However, Wise allows you to get a Dutch IBAN without a BSN, and Bunq may let you start the process before your BSN is issued. We recommend opening a Wise account before arriving in the Netherlands so you have a functioning account from day one."
  - q: "Which Dutch bank has the best English-language support?"
    a: "Among traditional banks, ING offers the best English-language experience with a fully English app, website, and customer service. ABN AMRO also provides strong English support. Among digital banks, Bunq, Wise, and N26 all operate primarily in English and are built for an international audience."
  - q: "How long does it take to open a bank account in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Digital banks like Wise, Bunq, and N26 can be set up within minutes to a few hours. Traditional banks typically take 1-2 weeks after your initial application, as they may require an in-person appointment or document verification. Having your BSN, valid ID, and proof of address ready speeds up the process significantly."
  - q: "Do I need a Dutch bank account to receive my salary?"
    a: "Most Dutch employers require a bank account with a Dutch IBAN (starting with NL). A Wise account with a Dutch IBAN fulfills this requirement. Some employers may specifically ask for a traditional Dutch bank account, but this is becoming less common."
  - q: "What fees do Dutch banks charge?"
    a: "Traditional Dutch banks charge between EUR 1.95 and EUR 5.95 per month for a basic account. Most also charge fees for international transfers (EUR 5-15 per transfer). Digital banks vary: Bunq starts at EUR 2.99 per month, N26 has a free basic tier, Wise charges no monthly fee but takes a small percentage on currency conversions, and Revolut offers a free basic plan."
  - q: "Can I use my foreign bank account in the Netherlands?"
    a: "You can use a foreign bank account temporarily, but it is impractical long-term. Many Dutch services (salary payments, rent, subscriptions, government payments) require a Dutch IBAN. Additionally, using a foreign card for daily purchases may incur currency conversion fees. We recommend setting up a Dutch banking option within your first two weeks."
  - q: "Is Wise a real bank account for the Netherlands?"
    a: "Wise is not a traditional bank, but an authorized Electronic Money Institution regulated in Europe. Your Wise account comes with a genuine Dutch IBAN that works for salary deposits, direct debits, and all standard banking functions in the Netherlands. For most expats, it functions identically to a traditional bank account for daily use."

When I arrived in the Netherlands, I spent two weeks without a functioning bank account -- which meant no salary payment, no iDEAL for online shopping, and my British card being declined at the Albert Heijn self-checkout. It was a mess. I have since opened accounts at almost every bank on this list, and I guide my expat clients through this decision every week. Here are the 7 best banking options for expats in 2026 and which one suits your situation.

## Our Top 3 Recommendations

Before diving into each bank in detail, here are our top picks:

1. **Best first account (open before you arrive)**: [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52)
2. **Best digital bank for daily use in the Netherlands**: [Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/nl)
3. **Best traditional bank for long-term residents**: ING

Most expats benefit from having two accounts: a [Wise account](https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52) for international transfers and currency conversion, plus either a traditional Dutch bank or Bunq for everyday Dutch banking.

---

## 1. Wise -- Best First Account for Expats

[Wise](https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52) (formerly TransferWise) is the single best financial tool for anyone moving to the Netherlands. It solves the biggest problem new expats face: you need a bank account before you have a BSN, and you need to transfer money internationally without getting destroyed by exchange rate markups.

### Key Features

- **Dutch IBAN included**: Your Wise account comes with a genuine NL-prefixed IBAN, accepted by Dutch employers for salary payments
- **Multi-currency account**: Hold and convert over 50 currencies at the real mid-market exchange rate
- **Low transfer fees**: International transfers cost a fraction of what traditional banks charge (typically 0.3-0.7% depending on the currency pair)
- **No monthly fee**: The account itself is free; you only pay when you convert currency or make international transfers
- **Debit card**: A Wise debit card for everyday purchases in the Netherlands

### Opening Requirements

- Valid passport or ID
- Proof of address (can be from your home country initially)
- No BSN required
- Can be opened from anywhere in the world

### Why Expats Love It

The ability to open an account before arriving in the Netherlands is invaluable. You can transfer your savings at the best exchange rate, have a working Dutch IBAN for your employment contract, and avoid the panicked search for banking during your first chaotic weeks.

### Limitations

- Not a full bank (no mortgage products, no investment accounts)
- iDEAL payments work via direct debit, not native iDEAL integration
- No physical branches
- Cash deposits are not possible

### Our Verdict

Every expat moving to the Netherlands should open a <a href="https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Wise account</a>. Even if you eventually set up a traditional Dutch bank account, Wise remains essential for international transfers and multi-currency management.

## 2. Bunq -- Best Digital Bank for Dutch Daily Life

[Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/nl) is a Dutch-born digital bank that has built a strong following among expats and tech-savvy locals. It offers a full banking experience with features that traditional banks are still catching up to.

### Key Features

- **Multiple sub-accounts**: Create up to 25 bank accounts (IBANs) for budgeting, each with their own name and card

- **Savings accounts**: Competitive interest rates on savings

### Plans and Pricing

- **Easy Bank**: EUR 2.99 per month (1 account, 1 card)
- **Easy Money**: EUR 8.99 per month (up to 25 accounts, 3 cards, savings interest)
- **Easy Green**: EUR 18.99 per month (everything in Easy Money plus green features, metal card, higher savings interest)

### Opening Requirements

- Valid passport or EU ID
- BSN (may allow initial registration before BSN is issued)
- European address
- Can be opened entirely online in minutes

### Why Expats Love It

Bunq was designed for the digital-first generation. The app is intuitive, fully in English, and packed with features. The multiple sub-accounts feature is particularly useful for budgeting: create separate accounts for rent, groceries, savings, and shared expenses with your partner.

### Limitations

- Monthly fees are higher than traditional banks for comparable features
- Smaller bank, so some landlords or services may not recognize it immediately
- No physical branches
- Customer service can be slow during peak times

### Our Verdict

If you want a modern, fully digital banking experience that works seamlessly in the Netherlands, [Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/nl) is the best option. The Easy Money plan offers exceptional value for the features provided.

## 3. N26 -- Best Free Digital Bank Account

[N26](https://n26.com/en-nl) is a German digital bank with a significant presence across Europe, including the Netherlands. Its free tier makes it an attractive option for budget-conscious expats.

### Key Features

- **Free basic account**: EUR 0 per month with a virtual Mastercard debit card
- **Clean, intuitive app**: One of the best-designed banking apps available
- **Spaces**: Sub-accounts for saving toward specific goals
- **Free ATM withdrawals**: 3-5 free withdrawals per month depending on plan
- **Real-time notifications**: Instant alerts for all transactions

### Plans and Pricing

- **Standard**: EUR 0 per month (virtual card, basic features)
- **Smart**: EUR 4.90 per month (physical card, shared spaces, priority support)
- **You**: EUR 9.90 per month (travel insurance, more ATM withdrawals)
- **Metal**: EUR 16.90 per month (premium metal card, comprehensive insurance)

### Opening Requirements

- Valid passport or EU ID
- European address
- BSN (required for tax reporting)
- Online application takes approximately 10 minutes

### Why Expats Love It

The free tier is genuinely useful. You get a real bank account with a German IBAN (not Dutch, which is a consideration), real-time notifications, and a modern app, all without paying a monthly fee.

### Limitations

- **German IBAN, not Dutch**: This is the biggest drawback. Some Dutch services, employers, or landlords may not accept a non-NL IBAN, although this is technically illegal under EU regulations (IBAN discrimination)
- No iDEAL support
- Limited Dutch-specific features
- Cash deposits are not supported in the free plan
- Customer service is online only

### Our Verdict

N26 is a solid free option for a secondary account or for expats who also spend time in other European countries. However, the German IBAN can cause practical issues in the Netherlands, so I recommend pairing it with a Wise or Bunq account. [Open an N26 account here](https://n26.com/en-nl).

## 4. ING -- Best Traditional Dutch Bank

ING is the largest bank in the Netherlands and the default choice for many residents. It offers the most comprehensive English-language experience among the traditional Dutch banks.

### Key Features

- **Full Dutch banking**: Savings, investments, mortgages, insurance, all in one place
- **Excellent English-language app and website**: Fully translated and maintained
- **Extensive ATM network**: ING ATMs are everywhere in the Netherlands
- **iDEAL integration**: Seamless support for the Dutch payment standard
- **Apple Pay and Google Pay**: Contactless payment support

### Pricing

- Basic current account: approximately EUR 2.45 per month
- Debit card: included
- International transfers: approximately EUR 5-15 per transfer (SWIFT), variable exchange rates

### Opening Requirements

- Valid passport or EU ID
- BSN
- Dutch address
- Either an in-branch appointment or online application (availability varies)

### Why Expats Choose It

ING is the safe, established choice. Your landlord, employer, and tax authority all know ING. The English-language support is excellent, the app is well-designed, and the branch and ATM network provides a safety net. If you plan to eventually buy property in the Netherlands, having a relationship with a traditional bank like ING is beneficial for mortgage applications.

### Limitations

- Monthly fees are comparable to other traditional banks
- International transfer fees and exchange rates are poor compared to Wise
- Opening process is slower than digital banks
- Innovation is slower than fintech alternatives
- Some services still require visiting a branch

### Our Verdict

ING is the best traditional bank for expats who want a full-service Dutch banking relationship. Ideal for long-term residents, especially those planning to buy property. Pair it with a Wise account for international transfers.

## 5. ABN AMRO -- Best for English-Speaking Service

ABN AMRO is the second-largest Dutch bank and offers strong English-language support with a slightly more international focus than its competitors.

### Key Features

- **International desk**: Dedicated service for expat customers
- **Full English app and online banking**: Comprehensive English interface
- **Wide product range**: Current accounts, savings, investments, mortgages, insurance
- **iDEAL and contactless payments**: Full Dutch payment integration

### Pricing

- Basic current account: approximately EUR 2.45 per month
- Additional cards or features may incur extra charges

### Opening Requirements

- Valid passport or EU ID
- BSN
- Dutch address
- Online or in-branch application

### Our Verdict

ABN AMRO is a strong alternative to ING, particularly if you value their international desk for expat-specific questions. The overall experience is comparable, so the choice between ING and ABN AMRO often comes down to which has a more convenient branch near your home.

---

## 6. Rabobank -- Best Outside the Randstad

Rabobank operates as a cooperative bank and has particularly strong coverage outside the Randstad (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht urban area). If you are moving to Eindhoven, Groningen, Maastricht, or a smaller Dutch city or town, Rabobank may be the most convenient option.

### Key Features

- **Strong local presence**: Extensive branch network, especially in smaller cities and rural areas
- **Cooperative model**: Customer-owned bank with a community focus
- **Full banking services**: Current accounts, savings, mortgages, insurance
- **Rabo app**: Modern and well-maintained

### Pricing

- Basic account: approximately EUR 1.95 per month (among the cheapest traditional options)
- International transfers: standard bank rates

### Limitations

- English-language support is less comprehensive than ING or ABN AMRO
- App and online banking have partial English translation
- Less focused on expat customers specifically

### Our Verdict

Rabobank is a good choice if you live outside the Randstad and want a local bank with physical branches nearby. The lower monthly fee is a nice bonus. However, if English-language support is a priority, ING or ABN AMRO are better choices.

## 7. Revolut -- Best for Frequent Travelers

Revolut is a UK-based fintech that has expanded across Europe. It is popular among expats who travel frequently or handle multiple currencies.

### Key Features

- **Multi-currency account**: Hold and exchange over 30 currencies
- **Free currency exchange**: Up to a monthly limit on the free plan (approximately EUR 1,000)
- **Low-cost international transfers**: Competitive rates for transfers outside the free exchange limit
- **Budgeting tools**: Spending insights, categories, and round-up savings
- **Crypto and stock trading**: Available in-app (premium plans)

### Pricing

- **Standard**: EUR 0 per month
- **Plus**: EUR 2.99 per month
- **Premium**: EUR 7.99 per month
- **Metal**: EUR 13.99 per month

### Limitations

- Lithuanian IBAN (not Dutch), which can cause issues with Dutch services
- No iDEAL support
- Not a full bank in the Netherlands
- Customer service quality has been inconsistent

### Our Verdict

Revolut is a useful secondary account for travel and multi-currency spending, but it should not be your primary bank in the Netherlands due to the non-Dutch IBAN and lack of iDEAL support.

## How to Open Your First Dutch Bank Account: Step by Step

1. **Before you move**: Open a [Wise account](https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52) to get a Dutch IBAN immediately. Transfer initial funds from your home country at the best exchange rate.

2. **After registration at the gemeente**: Once you have your BSN, apply for a traditional Dutch bank (ING or ABN AMRO recommended) or a full-featured digital bank ([Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/nl) or [N26](https://n26.com/en-nl)).

3. **Set up direct debits**: Link your health insurance, rent (if paid by direct debit), and utility payments to your Dutch bank account.

4. **Keep Wise for international transfers**: Continue using [Wise](https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52) whenever you need to send money internationally or convert currencies. The savings compared to traditional bank transfers add up quickly.

---

## What About iDEAL?

iDEAL is the dominant online payment system in the Netherlands. Nearly every Dutch webshop and service uses it. iDEAL is supported by all traditional Dutch banks (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank) and Bunq. It is not natively supported by N26, Revolut, or Wise.

If you shop online frequently in the Netherlands, having a bank account with iDEAL support is highly recommended. This is another reason we suggest having a Wise account for international use alongside a Dutch bank or Bunq for everyday Dutch payments.

## Final Recommendation

For most expats arriving in the Netherlands in 2026, I recommend this two-account setup:

1. **[Wise](https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52)** as your first and international account (open before you arrive)
2. **ING or [Bunq](https://www.bunq.com/nl)** as your primary Dutch bank for everyday use (open after receiving your BSN)

This combination gives you the best of both worlds: low-cost international transfers and multi-currency management with Wise, plus full Dutch banking integration (iDEAL, direct debits, ATMs) with your Dutch bank.

Start by opening your <a href="https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Wise account today</a> so you are ready to hit the ground running when you arrive.
