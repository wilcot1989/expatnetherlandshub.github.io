faq:
  - q: "How much does a gym membership cost in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Gym membership costs range from €15-€80/month. Budget gyms: Basic-Fit (€20-€30), Fit For Free (€15-€25). Mid-range: Trainmore (€30-€50), Sportcity (€35-€50). Premium: David Lloyd (€80-€120), Virgin Active (€60-€80). Most gyms have no registration fee if you commit to 12 months."
  - q: "What is the best gym chain in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Basic-Fit is the largest and most affordable (900+ locations, €20-€30/month). Trainmore is best for quality facilities with a premium feel at mid-range prices. David Lloyd is best for families (pools, tennis, kids' programs). For yoga/boutique fitness, Urban Sports Club gives access to hundreds of studios for one subscription."
  - q: "Can I cancel my gym membership easily?"
    a: "By Dutch law, gym memberships with a minimum contract period (usually 12 months) can be cancelled with 1 month notice after the initial period. Monthly contracts can be cancelled anytime with 1 month notice. Always cancel in writing (email or letter). Many gyms make cancellation deliberately difficult — be persistent."
  - q: "What sports are popular in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Most popular: football (soccer), cycling, running, fitness/gym, swimming, tennis, hockey (field hockey is huge in NL), skating, and rowing. The Netherlands has a strong club culture — joining a local sports club (sportvereniging) is one of the best ways to integrate and make Dutch friends."
  - q: "How do I join a sports club in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Search for local clubs at sportindebuurt.nl or your municipality's sports page. Most clubs welcome beginners and offer trial sessions. Membership costs €15-€50/month (much cheaper than commercial gyms). Popular expat-friendly sports: hockey, tennis, running clubs, and rowing. Many clubs have English-speaking members."
  - q: "Is cycling enough exercise in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Daily cycling for transport provides a great baseline of cardio fitness — the average Dutch person cycles 3 km/day. However, cycling at commuting pace doesn't fully replace strength training, flexibility work, or intense cardio. Many Dutch people combine daily cycling with gym, running, or sports club membership."

When I first moved here, I assumed all the cycling would keep me fit. It does help, but after a year of only biking to the supermarket, I realised I needed something more. I have since tried everything from Basic-Fit to a local hockey club -- yes, field hockey, the Dutch obsession I never expected to love. Here is my guide to staying fit in the Netherlands as an expat.
