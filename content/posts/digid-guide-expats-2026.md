faq:
  - q: "What is DigiD?"
    a: "DigiD (Digital Identity) is the Dutch government's online identification system. It is a username and password that verifies your identity when accessing government services online, similar to a digital passport for the internet. You need it to file taxes, access healthcare portals, check your pension, and interact with most government agencies."
  - q: "Do I need a BSN to get DigiD?"
    a: "Yes, you need a BSN (Burgerservicenummer/citizen service number) to apply for DigiD. You receive your BSN when you register at your local municipality (gemeente). Without a BSN, you cannot create a DigiD account."
  - q: "How long does it take to get DigiD?"
    a: "The online application takes 5 minutes. After applying, you receive an activation code by post within 3-5 business days (within the Netherlands). International mail takes 1-3 weeks. You must activate your account within 20 days of receiving the code."
  - q: "Can I use DigiD from outside the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes, you can use DigiD from anywhere in the world. This is useful for filing Dutch tax returns or checking pension information while abroad. However, the activation letter can only be sent to a Dutch address. If you need DigiD from abroad, you must apply at a Dutch embassy or consulate."
  - q: "What if I forgot my DigiD password?"
    a: "You can reset your password on digid.nl by clicking 'Forgot password.' You will need your BSN and the email address linked to your account. A new activation code will be sent to your registered Dutch address."
  - q: "Is the DigiD app mandatory?"
    a: "No, the app is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended. The app provides a higher security level and allows you to log in by scanning a QR code instead of entering your password. Some government services now require the DigiD app or SMS verification for extra security."

The first time someone asked me "Do you have a DigiD?" I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Turns out, it is the key to basically everything official in the Netherlands -- taxes, health insurance, subsidies, you name it. I put off setting mine up for weeks and regretted it immediately. Do not make my mistake. Here is how to get your DigiD sorted quickly and painlessly.

## What Is DigiD?

DigiD stands for **Digitale Identiteit** (Digital Identity). It is a login system created by the Dutch government that allows you to securely identify yourself online. Think of it as a government-issued username and password for accessing public services.

When you log into a government website with your DigiD, the system verifies your identity using your BSN (Burgerservicenummer). This means the website knows exactly who you are, just as if you showed your ID at a physical counter.

## Why You Need DigiD

You will need DigiD for virtually every interaction with the Dutch government and many public services:

| Service | Why You Need DigiD |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Belastingdienst (Tax office)** | File tax returns, check assessments, apply for toeslagen (subsidies) |
| **MijnOverheid** | Central government mailbox, official letters |
| **Health insurance** | Check coverage, declare care costs, choose provider |
| **UWV** | Unemployment benefits, sick leave |
| **SVB** | Child benefits (kinderbijslag), pension (AOW) |
| **Municipality** | Request documents, report moving, parking permits |
| **DUO** | Student loans, diploma recognition |
| **Pension fund** | Check pension accrual, retirement planning |
| **Kadaster** | Property ownership information |
| **RDW** | Vehicle registration, driver's license status |

**Without DigiD, you would need to visit physical offices for all of these — often with long wait times and limited opening hours.**

## Prerequisites

Before you can apply for DigiD, you need:

1. **A BSN (Burgerservicenummer)** — You receive this when you register at your local municipality. This is the first step after arriving in the Netherlands.

2. **A Dutch address** — The activation code is sent by physical mail to your registered address in the Basisregistratie Personen (BRP).

3. **A valid email address** — For account recovery and notifications.

4. **A Dutch mobile number** (recommended) — For SMS verification and the DigiD app.

## How to Get DigiD: Step by Step

### Step 1: Go to digid.nl

Visit **www.digid.nl** and click "Aanvragen" (Apply) or switch the language to English at the top of the page.

### Step 2: Enter Your Personal Details

You will need to provide:
- Your BSN (citizen service number)
- Date of birth
- Postal code and house number (must match your BRP registration)

### Step 3: Choose Your Username and Password

- **Username:** At least 6 characters, no spaces. Choose something you will remember but is not too obvious.
- **Password:** At least 8 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, and a number.

**Tip:** Use a password manager to store your DigiD credentials securely. Losing access to DigiD can be inconvenient.

### Step 4: Add Your Email and Phone Number

- Enter a valid email address
- Add your Dutch mobile number (recommended for SMS verification)

### Step 5: Wait for the Activation Letter

DigiD sends a physical letter to your registered Dutch address containing an activation code. This typically arrives within:
- **3-5 business days** within the Netherlands
- **1-3 weeks** if sent internationally (via Dutch embassy)

### Step 6: Activate Your Account

1. Return to **digid.nl**
2. Click "Activeren" (Activate)
3. Enter your username, password, and the activation code from the letter
4. Your DigiD is now active

**Important:** You must activate within 20 days of receiving the letter. After that, the code expires and you will need to request a new one.

## Setting Up the DigiD App

The DigiD app adds an extra layer of security and makes logging in faster. Some government services now require the app for higher security levels.

### How to Set Up the DigiD App

1. **Download** the DigiD app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android)
2. **Open** the app and tap "Activate"
3. **Log in** with your DigiD username and password
4. **Verify** via SMS (a code is sent to your registered phone number)
5. **Scan your ID** — Hold your passport or Dutch ID card against the back of your phone (NFC required). The app reads the chip in your document.
6. **Set a PIN** — Choose a 5-digit PIN for daily use
7. **Enable biometrics** (optional) — Fingerprint or face recognition for quick access

### Security Levels

DigiD has different security levels (betrouwbaarheidsniveaus):

| Level | Method | Used For |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Basis** | Username + password | Basic government sites |
| **Midden** | Username + password + SMS | Tax returns, toeslagen |
| **Substantieel** | DigiD app + ID scan | Health insurance, financial services |
| **Hoog** | DigiD app + ID scan + PIN | Highest security services |

Most government services require at least "Midden" level (SMS verification).

## Common Uses for Expats

### Filing Your Tax Return

Every year (typically March-April), you file your Dutch tax return at **mijn.belastingdienst.nl** using DigiD. The system pre-fills much of your information. Learn more in our [Dutch tax system guide](/posts/dutch-tax-system-expats-guide-2026/).

### Applying for Toeslagen (Subsidies)

The Netherlands offers several income-based subsidies:
- **Zorgtoeslag** — Health insurance allowance (up to €155/month)
- **Huurtoeslag** — Rent allowance
- **Kinderopvangtoeslag** — Childcare allowance
- **Kinderbijslag** — Child benefit

All applications go through **toeslagen.nl**, which requires DigiD.

### Checking Your Health Insurance

Access **mijnverzekerdegegevens.nl** to verify your health insurance status, check your deductible usage, and see which care costs have been declared. Compare plans using <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=8558&id=2776410" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Independer.nl</a>. Read our [health insurance guide](/posts/dutch-health-insurance-guide-expats-2026/).

### MijnOverheid — Your Digital Mailbox

Once you activate MijnOverheid (linked to DigiD), the government sends official letters digitally instead of by post. This includes tax assessments, municipality correspondence, and more. Set it up at **mijn.overheid.nl**.

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

### "BSN not recognized"
- Make sure you are registered at your municipality (BRP)
- Check that you are entering the correct BSN (it is 9 digits)
- If you recently registered, wait 1-2 business days for the system to update

### Activation letter not received
- Check that your postal code and house number match your BRP registration exactly
- Wait the full 5 business days before contacting support
- Check with your roommates or building management — letters sometimes go to shared mailboxes
- You can request a new activation letter on digid.nl

### DigiD app cannot read your ID
- Make sure NFC is enabled on your phone
- Remove any phone case that might block NFC
- Hold your passport flat against the back of your phone (near the top on most phones)
- Make sure you are using a passport with a chip (look for the chip symbol on the cover)
- The Dutch ID card works better than a passport for NFC reading

### Account locked
- DigiD locks after 3 failed login attempts
- Wait 15 minutes and try again
- If still locked, request a new activation letter

## Security Tips

1. **Never share your DigiD** — No one should ever ask for your DigiD credentials. The government, your employer, and your accountant should never need your login.

2. **Use a strong, unique password** — Do not reuse your DigiD password for any other account.

3. **Enable SMS verification** — This adds crucial security to your account.

4. **Set up the DigiD app** — The highest security level, and also the most convenient for daily use.

5. **Keep your phone number updated** — If you change your Dutch phone number, update it in DigiD immediately.
