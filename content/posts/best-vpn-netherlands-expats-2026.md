faq:
  - q: "Is it legal to use a VPN in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes. Using a VPN is completely legal in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has strong digital privacy laws, and there are no restrictions on VPN usage. However, using a VPN to engage in illegal activities remains illegal regardless of the VPN. Accessing geo-restricted content with a VPN may violate the terms of service of some streaming platforms, but this is a civil matter, not a criminal one."
  - q: "Can I use a VPN to watch my home country Netflix from the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes, in most cases. A good VPN lets you connect to a server in your home country, making it appear as though you are browsing from there. This typically unlocks your home Netflix library, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and other geo-restricted platforms. NordVPN and Surfshark are the most reliable options for bypassing Netflix geo-restrictions in 2026."
  - q: "Will a VPN slow down my internet speed in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Slightly, but with a premium VPN the difference is often negligible. The Netherlands has some of the fastest internet in Europe, so even with a 10-20% speed reduction from a VPN, you will still have more than enough bandwidth for HD and 4K streaming. Premium VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN typically reduce speeds by only 5-15% when connecting to nearby servers."
  - q: "Do I need a VPN for online banking while in the Netherlands?"
    a: "It depends on your bank. Some banks in certain countries block access from foreign IP addresses as a security measure. A VPN allows you to connect through a server in your home country, making it appear as though you are accessing your bank from home. This is particularly common with banks in the US, UK, and Australia. If you have trouble accessing your home banking app, try connecting to a VPN server in your home country first."
  - q: "Which VPN is best for streaming from the Netherlands?"
    a: "NordVPN and Surfshark are the most reliable for streaming in 2026. Both consistently unblock Netflix (multiple regions), BBC iPlayer, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video from their respective home regions. NordVPN has a slight edge in reliability, while Surfshark offers better value with unlimited simultaneous connections."
  - q: "Should I use a free VPN in the Netherlands?"
    a: "We strongly advise against free VPNs. Most free VPNs monetize by logging and selling your browsing data, which defeats the entire purpose of using a VPN. They also typically have very slow speeds, limited server locations, and data caps that make streaming impossible. The one exception is ProtonVPN's free tier, which has a strict no-logs policy but limits you to servers in 3 countries with slower speeds. For a few euros per month, a paid VPN like Surfshark provides dramatically better performance and privacy."
  - q: "Can I use a VPN on all my devices?"
    a: "Yes. All VPNs in this guide offer apps for Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and most also support Linux, smart TVs, routers, and browser extensions. Surfshark allows unlimited simultaneous device connections. NordVPN allows 10 devices. ExpressVPN allows 8 devices. This means you can protect your laptop, phone, tablet, and streaming device with a single subscription."

Moving to the Netherlands comes with many perks, but losing access to your favorite shows, your home banking app, and familiar online services is not one of them. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) solves these problems by letting you connect to servers in your home country, effectively browsing the internet as if you never left.

But a VPN is not just about streaming. For expats in the Netherlands, it is a practical tool for privacy on public WiFi, secure access to sensitive accounts, and maintaining digital connections to your home country.

This guide compares the best VPNs for expats in the Netherlands in 2026, with a focus on the features that matter most to people living abroad.

## Why Expats in the Netherlands Need a VPN

### 1. Access Home Country Streaming Content

This is the number one reason expats use a VPN. When you move to the Netherlands, your streaming libraries change. Netflix shows you Dutch content. BBC iPlayer blocks you entirely. Hulu does not work outside the US. A VPN lets you connect to a server in your home country and access your familiar content.

**Common streaming access issues for expats:**
- US: Hulu, HBO Max, US Netflix library, Peacock
- UK: BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, Channel 4, UK Netflix library
- Australia: Stan, 9Now, 10 Play
- Germany: German Netflix, ARD/ZDF Mediathek
- Any country: Local sports broadcasts, regional news

### 2. Secure Public WiFi

The Netherlands is full of free WiFi, from NS trains and stations to cafes, coworking spaces, libraries, and even some city centers. While convenient, public WiFi is a security risk. Anyone on the same network can potentially intercept your data. A VPN encrypts your connection, making it safe to use public WiFi for banking, email, and other sensitive activities.

This is especially relevant when you first arrive. You may spend significant time in hotels, Airbnbs, and cafes while searching for housing, all on unfamiliar WiFi networks.

### 3. Access Home Banking and Financial Services

Many banks flag or block logins from foreign IP addresses. If your home country bank sees you logging in from a Dutch IP address, it may lock your account as a security precaution. A VPN lets you connect through your home country, avoiding these issues.

This is particularly important during the transition period when you are still using your home country bank accounts alongside your new Dutch bank. For setting up Dutch banking, see our guide to the [best bank accounts for expats in the Netherlands](/posts/best-bank-account-expats-netherlands-2026/).

### 4. Privacy from ISPs and Data Collection

While the Netherlands has relatively strong privacy laws under the GDPR, your internet service provider (ISP) can still see your browsing activity. A VPN prevents this by encrypting all your traffic, meaning your ISP sees only that you are connected to a VPN, not what you are doing.

### 5. Bypass Regional Price Differences

Some online services, including flights, hotels, and software subscriptions, show different prices based on your location. A VPN lets you compare prices from different regions, potentially saving money.

## Tips for Using a VPN as an Expat in the Netherlands

### For Streaming

- If a streaming service detects your VPN and blocks it, try switching to a different server in the same country. VPN providers constantly rotate IP addresses to stay ahead of blocks.
- For the most reliable streaming experience, use the VPN provider's desktop or mobile app rather than the browser extension.
- If you use a smart TV that does not support VPN apps, consider installing the VPN on your router. NordVPN and ExpressVPN both offer easy-to-follow router setup guides.

### For Online Banking

- Connect to your home country server before opening your banking app or website.
- Some banks use additional detection beyond IP addresses. If you are still blocked, try clearing your browser cookies or using an incognito window.
- Consider setting up a <a href="https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/willemt52" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Wise account</a> for international transfers. Wise works globally without VPN issues and offers far better exchange rates than traditional banks. See our [guide to the best bank accounts for expats](/posts/best-bank-account-expats-netherlands-2026/).

### For Work

- If your employer uses a corporate VPN, check whether it conflicts with your personal VPN. Most modern VPNs handle this gracefully with split tunneling.
- Some Dutch companies and coworking spaces may block VPN traffic on their networks. In this case, try connecting on port 443 (HTTPS port) or using the VPN's obfuscation mode.

### For Public WiFi Safety

The Netherlands has extensive public WiFi, especially on NS trains, in Albert Heijn stores, at libraries, and at train stations. Always enable your VPN before connecting to any public WiFi network. The auto-connect feature handles this automatically.

## Our Final Recommendation

For most expats in the Netherlands, we recommend **[NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830)**. It offers the best combination of speed, streaming reliability, privacy, and ease of use. At around EUR 3.49 per month on the two-year plan, it costs less than a single koffie verkeerd per month.

If budget is your primary concern or you have a large household with many devices, **[Surfshark]({{surfshark_link}})** is the better choice, offering unlimited connections at an even lower price.

Whatever you choose, getting a VPN set up should be one of your first steps as an expat. It keeps you connected to home, protects your privacy on Dutch public WiFi, and ensures you can access your financial accounts without issues.
