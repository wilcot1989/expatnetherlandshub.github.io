faq:
  - q: "How do I choose an energy provider in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Compare providers on comparison sites like Gaslicht.com, Pricewise.nl, or Independer.nl. Key factors: contract type (fixed vs variable vs dynamic), price per kWh, monthly fixed costs, and contract duration. Most contracts are monthly cancellable. Switch anytime for free."
  - q: "How much does energy cost in the Netherlands in 2026?"
    a: "Average costs for a household are €150-€250/month (gas + electricity). Electricity costs €0.25-€0.40/kWh depending on contract type. Gas costs €1.20-€1.60/m³. Dynamic contracts can be cheaper but prices fluctuate hourly."
  - q: "What is a dynamic energy contract?"
    a: "A dynamic contract charges the real-time hourly electricity price from the European energy exchange (EPEX). Prices change every hour and are known a day in advance. You can save 10-25% by shifting consumption to cheaper hours (night, sunny afternoons). Providers: Tibber, Frank Energie, ANWB Energie."
  - q: "Can I switch energy providers easily in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes, switching is very easy and free. Most contracts are monthly cancellable. When you choose a new provider, they handle the entire switch process including notifying your old provider. The switch takes 1-3 weeks with no interruption in supply."
  - q: "Do I need to arrange energy when I move to a new home?"
    a: "Yes, you should arrange an energy contract before or on the day you move in. If you do not choose a provider, you will be assigned to the default supplier at higher rates. Compare and sign up at least 1 week before your move date."
  - q: "What is a smart meter and do I need one?"
    a: "A smart meter (slimme meter) sends your consumption data digitally to your provider, enabling accurate billing (no estimates) and is required for dynamic contracts. Your network operator installs it for free upon request. Over 90% of Dutch households now have one."

I accidentally left my energy contract on the default provider for six months after moving into my apartment and massively overpaid. Turns out, switching energy providers in the Netherlands is free and takes five minutes -- I just did not know that. It is one of those things nobody tells you when you arrive. Here is how to choose the right energy contract from the start so you do not repeat my expensive mistake.

## How the Dutch Energy Market Works

### Key Concepts

| Term | What It Means |
|------|-------------|
| **Leverancier** | Energy supplier (who you pay) |
| **Netbeheerder** | Grid operator (Liander, Stedin, Enexis — fixed based on location) |
| **Slimme meter** | Smart meter for real-time consumption data |
| **Salderingsregeling** | Net metering for solar panel owners |
| **Energiebelasting** | Energy tax (included in your per-kWh price) |
| **Vastrecht** | Fixed monthly fee (regardless of consumption) |

**Important:** You can choose your energy supplier (leverancier) but NOT your grid operator (netbeheerder) — that is determined by your location.

## Contract Types

### 1. Fixed Contract (Vast Contract)
- **Price:** Fixed per kWh for the contract duration (1-3 years)
- **Advantage:** Price certainty, no surprises
- **Disadvantage:** Usually more expensive than variable/dynamic
- **Best for:** Budget predictability, risk-averse expats

### 2. Variable Contract (Variabel Contract)
- **Price:** Changes monthly or quarterly based on market prices
- **Advantage:** Lower average price than fixed, monthly cancellable
- **Disadvantage:** Prices can spike during energy crises
- **Best for:** Flexible budget, willing to accept some risk

### 3. Dynamic Contract (Dynamisch Contract)
- **Price:** Changes hourly based on real-time energy exchange prices
- **Advantage:** Lowest average price (10-25% savings possible)
- **Disadvantage:** Requires active management, prices can spike
- **Best for:** Tech-savvy expats with smart meters, EV owners, solar panel owners

## Best Energy Providers for Expats

### Major Providers

| Provider | English Support | Contract Types | Green Energy | Notes |
|----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Vattenfall** | ✅ Website + phone | Fixed, variable | Optional | Largest provider, reliable |
| **Eneco** | ✅ Website | Fixed, variable | ✅ Default | Well-known Dutch brand |
| **Essent** | Partial | Fixed, variable | Optional | Part of E.ON group |
| **Budget Energie** | ❌ | Fixed, variable | ✅ Default | Budget option |

### Dynamic Energy Providers

| Provider | English Support | Monthly Fee | Electricity Markup | Best For |
|----------|---------------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Tibber** | ✅ App | €4.99 | €0.02/kWh | Smart home, EV charging |
| **Frank Energie** | ❌ | €2.95 | €0.01/kWh | Lowest cost |

**Our recommendation for expats:** Start with **Vattenfall** or **Eneco** (fixed or variable) for English support and simplicity. Once settled, consider switching to a dynamic provider like **Tibber** for potential savings.
