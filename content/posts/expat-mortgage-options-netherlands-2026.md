faq:
  - q: "Can expats get a mortgage in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes, expats can get mortgages in the Netherlands, even without permanent residency. You typically need a valid residence/work permit, employment contract (preferably permanent), and BSN number. Some lenders specialize in expat mortgages and are more flexible with requirements."
  - q: "How much can I borrow for a mortgage in the Netherlands?"
    a: "In 2026, you can borrow up to 100% of the property value (appraised value, not purchase price). The maximum amount depends on your gross income and existing debts. As a rule of thumb, you can borrow roughly 4.5x your gross annual income. Two-income households can combine incomes."
  - q: "Does the 30% ruling affect my mortgage?"
    a: "Yes, the 30% ruling reduces your taxable income, which means lenders calculate your borrowing capacity based on your NET income (70% of gross). This significantly reduces your maximum mortgage. Some expat-specialized lenders use the full gross salary for calculation, which gives you more borrowing power."
  - q: "What interest rates can expats expect in 2026?"
    a: "Mortgage interest rates in the Netherlands range from 3.5% to 5.5% in 2026, depending on the fixed period and loan-to-value ratio. Rates are slightly higher than Dutch averages for expats due to perceived risk. Shopping around and using a mortgage advisor can save 0.2-0.5% on your rate."
  - q: "Do I need a permanent contract to get a mortgage?"
    a: "A permanent contract (vast contract) makes it significantly easier. With a temporary contract, you can still get a mortgage if your employer provides an intention statement (intentieverklaring) that the contract will be extended. Self-employed expats need at least 3 years of financial statements."
  - q: "What additional costs should I budget for when buying?"
    a: "Budget 4-6% of the purchase price for additional costs: transfer tax (overdrachtsbelasting, 2% for primary residence, 10.4% for investment), notary fees (€1,000-€2,000), mortgage advisor (€2,000-€3,500), valuation report (€500-€750), and structural survey (€300-€500)."

Buying a home in the Netherlands as an expat is entirely possible — and often makes financial sense compared to renting long-term. Mortgage rates are competitive, the buying process is well-structured, and several lenders specialize in serving international clients.

However, there are unique challenges: the 30% ruling's impact on borrowing capacity, temporary contracts, and navigating a process in Dutch. This guide walks you through everything step by step.

### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Residence permit** | Valid work/residence permit (EU citizens: free movement) |
| **BSN number** | Required for all financial transactions |
| **Employment** | Permanent contract preferred; temporary with intention letter possible |
| **Income** | Sufficient to cover mortgage payments (max ~35% of income) |

- Average of last 3 years' profit used for calculation

See our [ZZP freelancer guide](/posts/freelancer-zzp-guide-netherlands-2026/) for more on self-employment.

## How Much Can You Borrow?

### Borrowing Capacity Calculation

Your maximum mortgage depends on:
1. **Gross annual income** (or 70% if using 30% ruling)
2. **Interest rate** on the mortgage
3. **Existing debts** (student loans, car payments)
4. **Property value** (max 100% of appraised value)

### Example Calculations (2026)

| Gross Salary | Without 30% Ruling | With 30% Ruling* |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| €50,000 | ~€220,000 | ~€155,000 |
| €70,000 | ~€310,000 | ~€220,000 |
| €90,000 | ~€390,000 | ~€275,000 |
| €120,000 | ~€490,000 | ~€345,000 |
| €70K + €50K (couple) | ~€500,000 | ~€350,000 |

*Some lenders calculate based on full gross salary even with 30% ruling — always compare

### The 30% Ruling Challenge

The 30% ruling gives you a tax-free allowance of 30% of your salary, which is great for your net income but reduces your borrowing capacity because:

- Standard lenders use your **taxable income** (70% of gross) for calculation
- This reduces your maximum mortgage by approximately 30%
- Some expat-specialized mortgage advisors work with lenders who use your **full gross salary**

**Tip:** Always use a mortgage advisor who specializes in expat mortgages — they know which lenders offer the best terms for 30% ruling holders.

## Mortgage Types in the Netherlands

| Type | Dutch Name | How It Works | Best For |
|------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Annuity** | Annuïteitenhypotheek | Equal monthly payments (interest + repayment), fully paid off at end | Most buyers (tax-deductible) |
| **Linear** | Lineaire hypotheek | Decreasing payments (fixed repayment + decreasing interest) | Higher earners wanting faster payoff |
| **Interest-only** | Aflossingsvrij | Pay only interest, no repayment | Max 50% of property value only |

**Important:** Since 2013, only annuity and linear mortgages qualify for mortgage interest tax deduction (hypotheekrenteaftrek). This deduction significantly reduces your effective interest rate.

### Fixed Rate Periods

| Fixed Period | Typical Rate (2026) | Best For |
|-------------|--------------------|---------|
| 1 year | 3.5-4.0% | Expecting rate drops, short-term stay |
| 5 years | 3.8-4.3% | Flexible, moderate certainty |
| 10 years | 4.0-4.5% | Most common, good balance |
| 20 years | 4.3-5.0% | Maximum certainty |
| 30 years | 4.5-5.5% | Full mortgage term locked |

**Our recommendation:** 10-year fixed is the most popular and offers a good balance between rate certainty and flexibility. If you are unsure how long you will stay, 5-year fixed gives you more flexibility.

## The Buying Process: Step by Step

### Step 1: Determine Your Budget (2-4 weeks)
- Calculate maximum mortgage (use online calculators at hypotheker.nl or independer.nl)
- Add your own funds (savings for additional costs)
- Get a preliminary mortgage approval (voorlopige hypotheekofferte)

### Step 2: Find a Property (2-12 weeks)
- Search on Funda.nl (the main property platform)
- Consider hiring a buying agent (aankoopmakelaar) — costs €3,000-€6,000 but can save you much more through negotiation
- View properties and assess neighborhoods

### Step 3: Make an Offer (1-2 weeks)
- Work with your buying agent to determine a fair offer
- Negotiate with the seller's agent
- Sign the purchase agreement (koopovereenkomst)

### Step 4: Reflection Period (3 days)
- After signing, you have a **3 business day** cooling-off period where you can withdraw without penalty
- Use this time to confirm your decision

### Step 5: Arrange Your Mortgage (4-6 weeks)
- Compare offers from multiple lenders (or let your mortgage advisor do this)
- Get the property appraised (taxatie) — costs €500-€750
- Consider a structural survey (bouwkundig rapport) — costs €300-€500
- Finalize and sign the mortgage offer

### Step 6: Transfer at Notary (1 day)
- Both parties meet at the notary (notaris)
- Sign the deed of transfer (leveringsakte) and mortgage deed (hypotheekakte)
- Keys are handed over
- Notary registers the transfer at the Land Registry (Kadaster)

## Additional Costs

| Cost | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Transfer tax** | 2% of purchase price | 0% for buyers under 35 (properties up to €510,000) |
| **Notary fees** | €1,000-€2,000 | For both deeds |
| **Mortgage advisor** | €2,000-€3,500 | Highly recommended for expats |
| **Valuation report** | €500-€750 | Required by all lenders |
| **Structural survey** | €300-€500 | Optional but recommended |
| **Buying agent** | €3,000-€6,000 | Optional but valuable |
| **NHG guarantee** | 0.6% of mortgage | Optional, for mortgages up to €435,000 |
| **Moving costs** | €500-€2,000 | Varies widely |
| **Total additional costs** | **€7,000-€15,000** | **Budget 4-6% of purchase price** |

### National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG)

NHG (Nationale Hypotheek Garantie) offers protection for you and the lender:
- Available for mortgages up to €435,000 (2026)
- Costs 0.6% of the mortgage amount (one-time)
- Provides a safety net if you cannot pay due to divorce, unemployment, or disability
- Often results in 0.2-0.5% lower interest rate

## Tax Benefits of Buying

### Mortgage Interest Deduction (Hypotheekrenteaftrek)
You can deduct mortgage interest from your taxable income for up to 30 years:
- Deduction rate: up to 36.97% in the first tax bracket
- Example: €15,000/year interest × 36.97% = €5,546 tax savings
- Makes the effective interest rate significantly lower

### WOZ Value and Property Tax
- **OZB** (property tax): 0.1-0.3% of WOZ value per year
- **Eigenwoningforfait**: Add 0.35% of WOZ value to taxable income (if WOZ < €1,310,000)

## Tips for Expat Buyers

1. **Use an expat mortgage advisor** — They know which lenders work best with 30% ruling, temporary contracts, and international incomes
2. **Get pre-approved** — Know your budget before you start looking
3. **Budget for all costs** — The purchase price is not the total cost
4. **Consider NHG** — If eligible, the lower rate often outweighs the one-time cost
5. **Do not skip the structural survey** — Dutch houses can have hidden issues (foundation, subsidence)
6. **Include resolutive conditions** — Your offer should include conditions for financing and structural survey
7. **Learn about VvE** — If buying an apartment, check the owners' association (VvE) finances and maintenance plan

### Money Transfers for Down Payment

If you are transferring savings from abroad for your down payment or additional costs, use <a href="https://wise.com/invite/dic/digitalshieldpro" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Wise</a> to get the real exchange rate. Banks typically add 2-5% in hidden markups on large transfers — on a €20,000 transfer, that could cost you €400-€1,000.
