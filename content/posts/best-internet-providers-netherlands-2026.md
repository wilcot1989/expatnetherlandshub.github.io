faq:
  - q: "What is the best internet provider in the Netherlands for expats?"
    a: "For most expats, KPN is the best overall choice due to its excellent fiber network, reliable speeds, and English-language customer support. If fiber is not available at your address, Ziggo offers the best cable internet with speeds up to 1200 Mbps. Budget-conscious expats should consider Budget Thuis or Online.nl for lower prices on the same networks."
  - q: "Do Dutch internet providers offer English customer support?"
    a: "KPN and T-Mobile offer customer support in English via phone and chat. Ziggo's support is primarily in Dutch, though many agents speak English. Budget providers like Budget Thuis and Online.nl operate mainly in Dutch. If English-language support is a priority, KPN is the safest choice."
  - q: "Is fiber optic internet available everywhere in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Not yet, but coverage is expanding rapidly. As of 2026, approximately 70-75% of Dutch households have access to fiber (glasvezel). KPN has been the primary driver of fiber rollout. You can check availability at your address on the KPN website or via the national coverage checker at overalglasvezel.nl. If fiber is not available, cable internet from Ziggo is the next best option."
  - q: "How much does internet cost in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Basic internet packages start at around EUR 30-35 per month for speeds of 50-100 Mbps. Mid-range packages with 200-500 Mbps cost EUR 35-50 per month. Premium packages with 1000 Mbps or higher range from EUR 50-70 per month. Budget providers offer lower entry prices, often starting around EUR 28-32 per month. Most providers charge installation fees of EUR 0-50."
  - q: "Can I get internet in the Netherlands without a BSN?"
    a: "Most Dutch internet providers require a BSN and a Dutch bank account to set up a contract. If you have not received your BSN yet, some providers allow you to start the process with your passport and proof of address, completing the BSN requirement later. Alternatively, ask your landlord or temporary housing provider about existing internet connections."
  - q: "What is the difference between fiber and cable internet in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Fiber (glasvezel) delivers data over fiber-optic cables, offering symmetrical upload and download speeds (e.g., 1000 Mbps both ways). Cable internet, primarily offered by Ziggo, delivers data over coaxial cables. Cable can reach high download speeds (up to 1200 Mbps) but upload speeds are much lower (typically 50-100 Mbps). Fiber is generally considered more reliable and future-proof."
  - q: "How long are Dutch internet contracts?"
    a: "Most Dutch internet providers offer 1-year or 2-year contracts. After the initial contract period, agreements convert to a monthly rolling contract that you can cancel with one month's notice. Some providers like KPN and Ziggo offer flex contracts with no fixed term at a slightly higher monthly price. By Dutch law, providers must make cancellation straightforward after the initial term."

One of the few things that genuinely impressed me when I moved to the Netherlands was the internet speed. Coming from the UK, where buffering was a way of life, Dutch fiber felt like magic. But actually choosing a provider? That part was confusing -- Dutch-only websites, unclear bundles, and conflicting advice from colleagues. After a decade of switching providers and helping clients set up their connections, here is my comparison of the 6 best options in 2026.

## Fiber vs Cable: Understanding Your Options

Before choosing a provider, you need to understand the two main types of internet infrastructure in the Netherlands.

### Fiber (Glasvezel)

Fiber-optic internet is the gold standard. It delivers data via thin glass cables using light signals, offering:

- **Symmetrical speeds**: Upload and download speeds are the same (e.g., 500/500 Mbps)
- **Low latency**: Ideal for video calls, gaming, and working from home
- **Future-proof**: Fiber infrastructure supports speeds well beyond current consumer needs
- **High reliability**: Less susceptible to interference and congestion

KPN has been the primary driver of fiber rollout across the Netherlands. T-Mobile and Odido also offer fiber where available, typically using the KPN or local fiber network.

### Cable (Kabel)

Ziggo operates the largest cable network in the Netherlands, covering approximately 95% of households. Cable internet offers:

- **High download speeds**: Up to 1200 Mbps on Ziggo's top tier
- **Lower upload speeds**: Typically 25-100 Mbps, significantly less than fiber
- **Shared bandwidth**: Speeds may drop during peak evening hours when many people in your neighborhood are online
- **Wide availability**: Available almost everywhere in the Netherlands

### Which Should You Choose?

If fiber is available at your address, choose fiber. The symmetrical speeds and reliability make it the better option, especially for remote work. If fiber is not yet available, Ziggo's cable internet is a solid alternative that will meet most household needs.

You can check fiber availability at your address on [KPN's website](https://www.kpn.com) or at overalglasvezel.nl.

## 1. KPN -- Best Overall Internet Provider

KPN is the largest telecommunications company in the Netherlands and the primary builder of the national fiber network. For expats, it offers the best combination of speed, reliability, and English-language support.

### Plans and Pricing (2026)

| Plan | Download | Upload | Monthly Price |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Internet 100 Mbps | 100 Mbps | 100 Mbps | ~EUR 35 |
| Internet 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps | ~EUR 45 |
| Internet 1000 Mbps | 1000 Mbps | 1000 Mbps | ~EUR 55 |
| Internet 8000 Mbps | 8000 Mbps | 8000 Mbps | ~EUR 75 |

*Prices are approximate and may vary based on promotions and contract length. Where fiber is not available, KPN offers DSL with lower speeds.*

### Pros

- Largest fiber network in the Netherlands with ongoing expansion
- Symmetrical upload and download speeds on fiber
- English-language customer support via phone and chat
- Excellent router (Fritz!Box) included with most plans
- iTV television service available as an add-on
- Reliable network with minimal downtime
- Good app for managing your account and monitoring usage

### Cons

- More expensive than budget alternatives
- DSL speeds are much slower where fiber is not yet available
- Installation can take 1-3 weeks depending on your area
- 2-year contracts offer the best prices, but lock you in

### English Support

KPN offers customer support in English via their phone line and online chat. Their website can be navigated in English for basic tasks, though some deeper pages remain in Dutch. The My KPN app is available in English.

### Our Verdict

KPN is the best overall choice for expats in the Netherlands. The fiber network is fast and reliable, the English-language support makes problem-solving manageable, and the Fritz!Box router provides excellent Wi-Fi coverage. If you work from home, KPN fiber is the gold standard.

## 2. Ziggo -- Best Cable Internet

Ziggo (owned by VodafoneZiggo) operates the dominant cable network in the Netherlands. With near-universal coverage, Ziggo is available at virtually every Dutch address, making it the go-to option when fiber is not available.

### Plans and Pricing (2026)

| Plan | Download | Upload | Monthly Price |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Start | 75 Mbps | 25 Mbps | ~EUR 35 |
| Standaard | 300 Mbps | 50 Mbps | ~EUR 42 |
| Max | 600 Mbps | 50 Mbps | ~EUR 52 |
| Giga | 1200 Mbps | 100 Mbps | ~EUR 65 |

*Ziggo also offers bundle packages with television and phone.*

### Pros

- Available at approximately 95% of Dutch addresses
- High download speeds, even on the entry-level plan
- Competitive bundle pricing when combined with TV and phone
- Modern Connect Box router included
- Quick installation, often within a week
- Integration with Vodafone mobile plans for discounts

### Cons

- Upload speeds are significantly lower than download speeds
- Speeds can drop during peak evening hours due to shared cable bandwidth
- English customer support is limited; most agents speak Dutch primarily
- Website is primarily in Dutch
- Cable technology is less future-proof than fiber

### English Support

Ziggo's customer support is primarily in Dutch, though many agents can communicate in basic English. Their website and app are in Dutch. For English-speaking expats, this can be frustrating when troubleshooting issues. If English support is essential, KPN is a safer choice.

### Our Verdict

Ziggo is the best cable internet provider and the right choice if fiber is not available at your address. The download speeds are impressive, and the near-universal coverage means you can get connected almost anywhere. Just be aware of the limited upload speeds and Dutch-language customer support.

## 3. T-Mobile Thuis -- Best Value Fiber Bundle

T-Mobile (the Dutch operation, separate from T-Mobile US) offers competitive fiber internet packages that undercut KPN on price while delivering solid performance.

### Plans and Pricing (2026)

| Plan | Download | Upload | Monthly Price |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Internet 50 Mbps | 50 Mbps | 50 Mbps | ~EUR 30 |
| Internet 200 Mbps | 200 Mbps | 200 Mbps | ~EUR 35 |
| Internet 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps | ~EUR 42 |
| Internet 1000 Mbps | 1000 Mbps | 1000 Mbps | ~EUR 55 |

*T-Mobile offers discounts when bundling internet with their mobile plans.*

### Pros

- Lower prices than KPN for comparable fiber speeds
- Symmetrical speeds on fiber
- Good English-language customer support
- Bundle discounts with T-Mobile mobile plans
- Wi-Fi mesh system available for larger homes
- No activation fee during promotional periods

### Cons

- Uses the KPN fiber network, so availability depends on KPN rollout
- Router quality is not as consistently praised as KPN's Fritz!Box
- Fewer speed tier options than KPN
- TV add-on is less feature-rich than KPN iTV or Ziggo

### English Support

T-Mobile provides English-language support via phone and chat. Their app is available in English. The website is primarily in Dutch but can be managed with browser translation for ordering.

### Our Verdict

T-Mobile Thuis is the best value option for fiber internet. If you want fast, symmetrical fiber speeds without paying KPN's premium, T-Mobile delivers. The English-language support is a significant advantage over budget providers.

## 4. Odido -- Affordable Fiber Alternative

Odido (formerly Tele2, rebranded in 2023) offers fiber and DSL internet at competitive prices. As part of the T-Mobile Netherlands group, it uses the same network infrastructure but positions itself as a more affordable brand.

### Plans and Pricing (2026)

| Plan | Download | Upload | Monthly Price |
|------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Internet 50 Mbps | 50 Mbps | 50 Mbps | ~EUR 30 |
| Internet 200 Mbps | 200 Mbps | 200 Mbps | ~EUR 34 |
| Internet 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps | 500 Mbps | ~EUR 40 |
| Internet 1000 Mbps | 1000 Mbps | 1000 Mbps | ~EUR 50 |

### Pros

- Limited TV add-on options

### English Support

Odido's customer support is mostly in Dutch. Some agents speak English, but it is not guaranteed. The website and app are in Dutch. For expats who are comfortable using browser translation tools or have basic Dutch skills, Odido can save you money. For those who need reliable English support, KPN or T-Mobile are better options.

### Our Verdict

Odido is a solid choice for budget-conscious expats who do not need English-language support. The fiber speeds are excellent and the prices are lower than the big names. If you are comfortable navigating Dutch customer service or have a Dutch-speaking partner or colleague who can help, Odido offers great value.

## How to Set Up Internet in the Netherlands: Step by Step

1. **Check what is available at your address**: Visit the KPN, Ziggo, or a comparison site like Vergelijk.nl to see which types of internet (fiber, cable, DSL) are available at your new Dutch address.

2. **Choose your provider**: Use the comparison table above to pick the provider that best fits your needs for speed, price, and language support.

3. **Order online or by phone**: Most providers allow online ordering. KPN and T-Mobile accept orders in English by phone. You will need your Dutch address, BSN, and a Dutch bank account for direct debit.

4. **Schedule installation**: If your home needs a new connection or router, the provider will schedule a technician visit. This typically takes 1-3 weeks. If the previous tenant had the same provider, activation may be faster.

5. **Set up your router**: The provider supplies a router. Follow the setup instructions (most routers auto-configure). For larger homes or thick walls, consider adding a mesh Wi-Fi system for better coverage.

6. **Register for your online account**: Set up the provider's app to manage your connection, check speeds, and contact support.

## Tips for Expats

### Check Before You Rent

When viewing rental properties, ask about the existing internet connection. Some apartments come with a Ziggo or KPN connection included in the service charges. Others may have fiber pre-installed, making setup quick and easy.

### Speed Recommendations

- **Basic browsing and email**: 50-100 Mbps is sufficient
- **Working from home (video calls, cloud storage)**: 200-500 Mbps recommended
- **Household of 3+ people streaming and working simultaneously**: 500-1000 Mbps
- **Serious gamers or heavy uploaders**: 1000 Mbps fiber for symmetrical speeds

### Use a Comparison Site

Dutch comparison sites like Vergelijk.nl and Breedbandwinkel.nl let you enter your postcode and house number to see all available providers and current promotions. These are useful for finding limited-time discounts.

### Consider Bundles Carefully

Providers aggressively market bundles combining internet, TV, and phone. If you primarily stream content (Netflix, Disney+, YouTube) rather than watching traditional Dutch TV, you probably do not need a TV package. A standalone internet plan is usually cheaper.

### Protect Your Privacy with a VPN

Once your internet is set up, consider adding a VPN for privacy and to access streaming content from your home country. Your Dutch ISP can see your browsing activity, and a VPN encrypts this traffic. It also lets you connect to servers in your home country to watch Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and other services as if you never left. I recommend <a href="https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=612&aff_id=141337&url_id=14830" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">NordVPN</a> for expats in the Netherlands.

## Final Recommendation

For most expats arriving in the Netherlands in 2026, I recommend this approach:

1. **If fiber is available at your address**: Choose **KPN** for the best combination of speed, reliability, and English support. Choose **T-Mobile** or **Odido** if you want to save money on fiber.

2. **If only cable is available**: Choose **Ziggo** for the fastest speeds and the most complete package. Choose **Budget Thuis** if you want the lowest price.

3. **For remote workers**: Prioritize fiber internet for the symmetrical upload speeds that make video calls and file uploads smooth. KPN's 500 Mbps plan is the sweet spot for most home offices.

Check what is available at your address, pick the plan that matches your household needs, and you will be online within a week or two. The Netherlands has excellent internet infrastructure, so whichever provider you choose, you are unlikely to be disappointed.
