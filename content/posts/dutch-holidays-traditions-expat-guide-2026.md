faq:
  - q: "How many public holidays does the Netherlands have?"
    a: "The Netherlands has approximately 8-10 public holidays per year, though not all are official days off by law. Most employers give 7-8 days off: New Year's Day, King's Day (Apr 27), Good Friday (varies), Easter Monday, Liberation Day (May 5, once every 5 years), Ascension Day, Whit Monday, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day."
  - q: "What is King's Day and how do I celebrate?"
    a: "King's Day (Koningsdag, April 27) is the Netherlands' biggest national holiday celebrating the King's birthday. The entire country turns orange: street markets (vrijmarkt), outdoor parties, boat parades in Amsterdam, and live music everywhere. Wear orange, go to a vrijmarkt, and enjoy the festive atmosphere. Most businesses are closed."
  - q: "What is Sinterklaas?"
    a: "Sinterklaas is the Dutch version of Santa Claus, celebrated on December 5 (pakjesavond). He arrives by steamboat in mid-November with his helpers (Pieten). Children put their shoes by the fireplace and receive small gifts and poems. It's the primary gift-giving holiday in the Netherlands — more important than Christmas for many Dutch families."
  - q: "Is Christmas different in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Yes. Christmas in the Netherlands is relatively low-key compared to other countries because Sinterklaas (Dec 5) is the main gift-giving holiday. Christmas is focused on family dinners (gourmetten is popular), church services, and relaxation. December 25 and 26 (Tweede Kerstdag) are both public holidays."
  - q: "Do I get Liberation Day off work?"
    a: "Liberation Day (Bevrijdingsdag, May 5) celebrates the end of WWII occupation. It's officially a public holiday every year, but a paid day off only once every 5 years (next: 2025, then 2030). However, many employers give the day off annually. Festivals are held across the country with free concerts and events."
  - q: "What is Carnival in the Netherlands?"
    a: "Carnival is a 3-day celebration (Sunday-Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, usually in February) mainly in the southern provinces (Noord-Brabant and Limburg). Cities like Den Bosch, Eindhoven, Maastricht, and Breda transform into non-stop parties with costumes, parades, and music. It's not a national holiday but many southerners take days off."

My first King's Day in the Netherlands, I walked outside in a normal outfit and was immediately swallowed by a sea of orange. Thousands of people in orange wigs, orange suits, orange face paint -- selling old junk on blankets and dancing on boats in the canals. Nobody had warned me. That is the thing about Dutch holidays: they are wonderfully bizarre, and as a half-Dutch person who grew up in the UK, even I was caught off guard. Here is your heads-up for every major holiday and tradition so you will not be surprised by a closed supermarket or an unexpected orange invasion.

## The Big Celebrations

### King's Day (Koningsdag) — April 27

The biggest, loudest, most orange holiday in the Netherlands. The entire country celebrates the King's birthday.

**What happens:**
- **Vrijmarkt** — Everyone sells their stuff on the street (the only day you can trade tax-free)
- **Orange everywhere** — Clothes, wigs, face paint, food, drinks — everything turns orange
- **Live music** — Stages in every city, DJs on boats
- **Boat parties** — In Amsterdam, the canals are packed with party boats
- **Tompouce** — The traditional orange-topped pastry
- **Royal family** visits a different city each year

**Survival tips for expats:**
1. Wear orange (or risk standing out badly)
2. Bring cash for the vrijmarkt
3. In Amsterdam, arrive early — it gets incredibly crowded
4. Try a tompouce and oranje bitter (orange liqueur)
5. Public transport is limited — walk or cycle
6. Vondelpark area is popular for families with kids' vrijmarkt

### Sinterklaas — November/December

The most beloved Dutch tradition, especially for children.

**Timeline:**
- **Mid-November:** Sinterklaas arrives by steamboat (intocht) — live on TV
- **Nov-Dec 5:** Children put their shoe by the fireplace with a carrot for Sinterklaas' horse, and receive small gifts overnight
- **December 5 (Pakjesavond):** The main event — families exchange gifts with creative poems (gedichten) and surprise packages (surprises)

**What to know:**
- Sinterklaas is more important than Christmas for gift-giving
- Gifts are accompanied by humorous poems about the recipient
- "Surprises" are creative packages disguised as something else
- Traditional treats: pepernoten, speculaas, chocolate letters
- The tradition is evolving — Zwarte Piet has become Roetveegpiet (soot-wiped Pete)

**As an expat:**
- You might be invited to a Sinterklaas party — join in, write a poem!
- Office Sinterklaas celebrations are common (loting/drawing names)
- Buy chocolate letters at any supermarket (get the first letter of your name)

### Carnival — February/March (Southern Netherlands)

A 3-day explosion of costumes, parades, and party culture in the south.

**Where:** Noord-Brabant (Den Bosch, Eindhoven, Breda, Tilburg) and Limburg (Maastricht)
**When:** Sunday to Tuesday before Ash Wednesday (Feb-Mar)

**What to expect:**
- Cities get temporary names (Den Bosch becomes "Oeteldonk")
- Everyone wears costumes
- Parades with elaborate floats
- Non-stop music and dancing in bars and on streets
- Traditional songs everyone knows (you'll learn fast)

**Expat tip:** If you live in the south, Carnival is unmissable. If you live in the north, plan a weekend trip — it's a completely different Netherlands.

### New Year's Eve (Oud en Nieuw)

Dutch New Year's Eve is famously... explosive.

**Traditions:**
- **Oliebollen** — Deep-fried dough balls, the quintessential NYE food
- **Fireworks** — The Netherlands spends more on consumer fireworks per capita than almost any country
- **Champagne toast** at midnight
- **Nieuwjaarsduik** — New Year's Day polar plunge at beaches across the country (Scheveningen is the largest)

**Important:** Professional firework shows are increasingly common, but individual fireworks are still widespread. If you have pets, prepare them for a very loud night.

## Seasonal Traditions
