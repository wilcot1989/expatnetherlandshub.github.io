faq:
  - q: "What is the 30% ruling in the Netherlands?"
    a: "The 30% ruling is a Dutch tax benefit for highly skilled migrants recruited from abroad. It allows your employer to pay up to 30% of your gross salary as a tax-free allowance, intended to compensate for the additional costs of relocating to and living in the Netherlands. This effectively reduces your taxable income by 30%, resulting in significant tax savings."
  - q: "What is the salary threshold for the 30% ruling in 2026?"
    a: "In 2026, the minimum taxable salary (after applying the 30% reduction) is approximately EUR 46,107 per year for most applicants. For employees under 30 who hold a qualifying master's degree, the reduced threshold is approximately EUR 35,048. These figures are adjusted annually and published by the Belastingdienst (Dutch Tax Authority)."
  - q: "How long does the 30% ruling last?"
    a: "The 30% ruling applies for a maximum of 5 years (60 months). This was reduced from 8 years in 2019. Time previously spent living or working in the Netherlands may be deducted from this 5-year period. Important: legislative changes effective from January 2024 introduced a phased reduction from 30% to 27% and then 10% over the 5-year period. Check the latest rules, as further adjustments have been proposed."
  - q: "Can I apply for the 30% ruling if I am already living in the Netherlands?"
    a: "No. One of the key requirements is that you must be recruited or transferred from abroad. Specifically, you must have been living more than 150 kilometers from the Dutch border for at least 16 of the 24 months before your Dutch employment started. If you were already living in the Netherlands when you were hired, you do not qualify."
  - q: "Does the 30% ruling apply if I change employers?"
    a: "Yes, but with conditions. You can transfer the 30% ruling to a new employer, provided there is no gap longer than 3 months between jobs. Your new employer must apply for the ruling within 4 months of your new employment start date. The remaining duration of your original 5-year period carries over; it does not restart."
  - q: "What happens to the 30% ruling if I leave and return to the Netherlands?"
    a: "If you leave the Netherlands and return, you may still be eligible for the remaining duration of your original 30% ruling period, provided you return within the validity window and meet all other conditions. However, each case is assessed individually by the Belastingdienst. Breaks in residence and employment can complicate the situation, so consult a tax advisor before making decisions."
  - q: "Should I hire a tax advisor for the 30% ruling?"
    a: "While it is possible to handle the 30% ruling application through your employer's HR department, hiring a tax advisor who specializes in expat taxation is highly recommended, particularly if your situation involves complications such as income from multiple countries, a partner who also works, investment income, or real estate. A good tax advisor typically costs EUR 150-500 for an initial consultation and can save you thousands in optimized tax planning."

The 30% ruling is one of the most valuable financial benefits available to expats in the Netherlands. For qualifying highly skilled migrants, it can reduce your effective income tax by thousands of euros per year, making the Netherlands even more attractive as a destination for international talent.

But the ruling is also one of the most frequently misunderstood aspects of Dutch expat life. Eligibility criteria are strict, the rules have changed repeatedly in recent years, and the interaction with other tax provisions can be complex.

This guide covers everything you need to know about the 30% ruling in 2026: what it is, who qualifies, how to apply, how much you save, and what recent legislative changes mean for current and future applicants.

## What is the 30% Ruling?

The 30% ruling (30%-regeling) allows qualifying employers to pay up to 30% of an employee's gross salary as a tax-free allowance. This allowance is intended to cover the "extraterritorial costs" of living abroad, such as:

- Higher cost of living compared to the home country
- Double housing costs during the transition
- Travel to and from the home country
- Cost of maintaining ties abroad
- Language courses and cultural adaptation expenses

In practice, you do not need to prove these expenses. The 30% is a flat allowance applied to your gross salary, and it is not taxed as income.

### A Simple Example

Consider an expat earning a gross annual salary of EUR 80,000:

| Without 30% Ruling | With 30% Ruling |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Taxable income: EUR 80,000 | Taxable income: EUR 56,000 (70% of EUR 80,000) |
| Tax-free allowance: EUR 0 | Tax-free allowance: EUR 24,000 (30% of EUR 80,000) |
| Approximate income tax: EUR 29,500 | Approximate income tax: EUR 18,300 |
| **Net income: ~EUR 50,500** | **Net income: ~EUR 61,700** |

In this example, the 30% ruling saves approximately EUR 11,200 per year in income tax. Over the full 5-year duration, that amounts to over EUR 56,000 in savings.

*Note: These figures are simplified illustrations. Your actual tax savings depend on your specific salary, deductions, and applicable tax rates. The phased reduction introduced in 2024 also affects the calculation (see below).*

## Eligibility Criteria

The 30% ruling is not available to everyone. You must meet all of the following conditions:

### 1. Recruited or Transferred from Abroad

You must have been recruited from outside the Netherlands or transferred to the Netherlands by your employer. The key requirement is the **150-kilometer rule**: you must have been living more than 150 kilometers from the Dutch border for at least 16 of the 24 months before your Dutch employment started.

This means that if you were already living in the Netherlands, Belgium, western Germany, or Luxembourg when you started your Dutch job, you likely do not qualify.

### 2. Specific Expertise

You must possess specific expertise that is scarce or not readily available in the Dutch labor market. In practice, this is demonstrated by meeting the salary threshold (see below). The Belastingdienst considers the salary test as the primary indicator of specific expertise for most applicants.

### 3. Minimum Salary Threshold (2026)

Your taxable salary (after the 30% reduction) must meet or exceed the minimum threshold:

| Category | Approximate Annual Taxable Salary (2026) |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Standard applicants (30 and older) | EUR 46,107 |
| Applicants under 30 with a qualifying master's degree | EUR 35,048 |
| Scientific researchers at designated institutions | No minimum threshold |

These figures are adjusted annually for inflation. Always check the latest thresholds on the Belastingdienst website or with your tax advisor.

To work out the required gross salary, divide the threshold by 0.7. For the standard threshold: EUR 46,107 / 0.7 = approximately EUR 65,867 gross annual salary.

### 4. Employer Must Be a Withholding Agent

Your employer must be registered as a withholding agent with the Dutch Tax Authority. Virtually all Dutch employers with employees meet this requirement.

### 5. Written Agreement

You and your employer must have a written agreement that the 30% ruling will be applied, and the employer and employee must jointly submit the application.

## How to Apply

The application process is straightforward, but timing matters.

### Step 1: Check Eligibility

Before applying, verify that you meet all criteria: the 150-kilometer rule, the salary threshold, and the recruitment-from-abroad requirement. If you are unsure, consult a tax advisor.

### Step 2: Joint Application

The application must be submitted jointly by you and your employer. In practice, many employers handle the process through their HR or payroll department, or through a tax advisory firm.

You submit the application to the Belastingdienst (Dutch Tax Authority) using the designated form.

### Step 3: Timing

You should apply within 4 months of starting your Dutch employment. If you apply later, the ruling will only take effect from the first day of the month following the application, rather than retroactively from your start date. This means late applications cost you money.

### Step 4: Processing Time

The Belastingdienst typically processes applications within 2-4 months. During this processing period, your employer can already apply the 30% tax-free allowance in your payroll on a provisional basis.

### Step 5: Receive the Decision

You will receive a formal decision (beschikking) from the Belastingdienst confirming whether the ruling is granted and for which period.

## Recent Changes and the Phased Reduction

The 30% ruling has undergone several significant changes in recent years. Understanding the timeline is important, because different rules may apply depending on when your ruling started.

### Historical Changes

- **Before 2012**: The ruling could last up to 10 years
- **2012**: Duration reduced to 8 years
- **2019**: Duration reduced to 5 years (with transitional arrangements for existing holders)
- **2024**: Introduction of a phased reduction (see below)

### The 2024 Phased Reduction

Starting January 1, 2024, the Dutch government introduced a step-down model for the 30% ruling:

| Period | Tax-Free Percentage |
|--------|-------------------|
| Months 1-20 (first 20 months) | 30% |
| Months 21-40 (next 20 months) | 20% |
| Months 41-60 (final 20 months) | 10% |

This means that the benefit decreases over the 5-year period. For new applicants, the effective average tax-free percentage over 5 years is 20%, not 30%.

### Transitional Rules

Expats who already had an active 30% ruling before January 1, 2024, may be entitled to transitional provisions that preserve the original 30% rate for the full duration of their ruling. The specifics depend on when your ruling was granted and when your employment started. This is an area where professional tax advice is strongly recommended.

### Proposed Changes for 2027 and Beyond

The Dutch government has debated further modifications to the ruling, including proposals to cap the ruling at the "Balkenende norm" (the salary ceiling for public sector employees, approximately EUR 233,000 in 2026) and to limit the maximum tax-free percentage to 27%. These proposals have been politically contentious.

As of early 2026, the exact rules for 2027 remain subject to legislative approval. If you are making decisions based on the 30% ruling, check the latest status with the Belastingdienst or a qualified tax advisor.

## Tax Savings Calculation by Salary Level

To give you a realistic picture of the financial impact, here is how the 30% ruling affects take-home pay at various salary levels. These calculations use 2026 approximate tax rates and apply the first-20-months rate of 30%.

| Gross Annual Salary | Taxable Without Ruling | Taxable With 30% Ruling | Approximate Annual Tax Saving |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| EUR 70,000 | EUR 70,000 | EUR 49,000 | ~EUR 8,500 |
| EUR 80,000 | EUR 80,000 | EUR 56,000 | ~EUR 11,200 |
| EUR 100,000 | EUR 100,000 | EUR 70,000 | ~EUR 14,800 |
| EUR 120,000 | EUR 120,000 | EUR 84,000 | ~EUR 17,500 |
| EUR 150,000 | EUR 150,000 | EUR 105,000 | ~EUR 21,000 |

*These are simplified estimates. Actual savings depend on your specific deductions, tax credits, and the applicable marginal tax rates. The savings in months 21-40 and 41-60 will be lower due to the phased reduction.*

## Additional Benefits of the 30% Ruling

Beyond the direct tax savings, the 30% ruling provides several other advantages:

### 1. Partial Non-Resident Taxpayer Status (Box 2 and Box 3)

Holders of the 30% ruling can choose to be treated as partial non-resident taxpayers for Box 2 (income from substantial shareholding) and Box 3 (income from savings and investments). This means:

- **Box 3 exemption**: You are not taxed on worldwide savings and investments, only on Dutch real estate holdings. For expats with significant savings or investment portfolios abroad, this can be extremely valuable.
- **Box 2 treatment**: Only taxed on Dutch substantial shareholdings, not foreign ones.

This benefit alone can save thousands of euros per year for expats with substantial savings or investment accounts in their home country.

### 2. Dutch Driving License Exchange

With the 30% ruling, you can exchange your foreign driving license for a Dutch one without taking driving lessons or exams. This applies even if your home country does not have an exchange agreement with the Netherlands. Without the 30% ruling, expats from many countries must retake the full Dutch driving exam, which is expensive and has a high failure rate.

### 3. International School Tax Deduction

The cost of international schooling for your children can be considered part of the extraterritorial expenses covered by the ruling. Discuss the specifics with your tax advisor.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Applying Too Late

Missing the 4-month application window costs you money. Apply as soon as possible after starting employment. Set a reminder and follow up with your employer's HR department.

### 2. Salary Just Below the Threshold

If your gross salary is close to the threshold, negotiate with your employer to ensure you qualify. A small salary increase can unlock tens of thousands of euros in tax savings over the ruling period.

### 3. Ignoring the Phased Reduction in Financial Planning

Do not assume 30% for the full 5 years. With the phased reduction, your effective benefit decreases over time. Factor this into long-term financial decisions like housing and savings targets.

### 4. Not Considering the Impact on Pension Contributions

Because the 30% allowance reduces your taxable salary, it can also reduce employer pension contributions that are calculated as a percentage of taxable salary. Discuss this with your employer to understand the full picture.

### 5. Forgetting to Reapply When Changing Employers

If you switch jobs, you must ensure continuity. The gap between employers cannot exceed 3 months, and your new employer must submit a fresh application. Coordinate this well in advance of your last day at your current job.

## The 30% Ruling and Your Broader Financial Picture

The 30% ruling does not exist in isolation. It interacts with other aspects of your financial life in the Netherlands:

### Mortgage Applications

Dutch banks consider your salary after the 30% ruling when assessing mortgage eligibility. Some banks use your full gross salary, while others use the reduced taxable amount. Since the ruling has a limited duration, banks may also stress-test your ability to afford the mortgage after the ruling expires. Discuss this with a mortgage advisor who has experience with expat clients.

### Social Security and Benefits

Your social security contributions are based on your taxable salary (after the 30% reduction). This means lower contributions during the ruling period, which can affect entitlements like unemployment benefits (WW) and disability benefits (WIA). The impact is usually modest but worth understanding.

### Retirement Planning

With lower taxable income during the ruling period, your pension accrual may be lower. Consider supplementing with private pension savings or investments. This is particularly important if you plan to stay in the Netherlands long-term.

## Step-by-Step: What to Do When You Arrive

Here is a practical timeline for managing the 30% ruling alongside your other arrival tasks:

1. **Before arrival**: Confirm with your employer that they will apply for the 30% ruling and ensure your salary meets the threshold
2. **Week 1**: Register at your gemeente and receive your BSN (see our [relocation guide](/posts/complete-guide-moving-to-netherlands-2026/))
3. **Week 1-2**: Provide your BSN to your employer for the 30% ruling application
4. **Month 1**: Employer submits the joint application to the Belastingdienst (within the 4-month window)
5. **Month 1-2**: Employer can begin applying the 30% reduction provisionally in your payslip
6. **Month 2-4**: Receive the formal decision from the Belastingdienst
7. **First tax year**: File your annual tax return by May 1 of the following year, claiming the partial non-resident status if beneficial

## Do You Need a Tax Advisor?

For straightforward cases -- a single employee with one Dutch employer and no foreign income or assets -- the 30% ruling can be managed by a knowledgeable HR department without a separate tax advisor.

However, a specialist expat tax advisor is strongly recommended if:

- You have income from multiple countries
- You own property abroad
- You have significant savings or investments in foreign accounts
- Your partner also works in the Netherlands
- You are a business owner or have freelance income
- You want to optimize the interaction between Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3 taxation
- You are navigating the transitional rules from before 2024

A good expat tax advisor typically charges EUR 150-500 for an initial consultation and EUR 300-800 for annual tax filing assistance. Given the amounts at stake with the 30% ruling, this is generally a worthwhile investment.

---

## Final Thoughts

The 30% ruling remains one of the most significant financial advantages of working in the Netherlands as an expat. Even with the phased reduction introduced in 2024, the tax savings over a 5-year period can amount to tens of thousands of euros.

The key is to act early: negotiate your salary with the threshold in mind, ensure your employer submits the application within 4 months of your start date, and seek professional tax advice for complex situations.
